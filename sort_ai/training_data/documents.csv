102353644,Outlier Detection for Improved Data Quality and Diversity in Dialog Systems,"In a corpus of data, outliers are either errors: mistakes in the data that are counterproductive, or are unique: informative samples that improve model robustness. Identifying outliers can lead to better datasets by (1) removing noise in datasets and (2) guiding collection of additional data to fill gaps. However, the problem of detecting both outlier types has received relatively little attention in NLP, particularly for dialog systems. We introduce a simple and effective technique for detecting both erroneous and unique samples in a corpus of short texts using neural sentence embeddings combined with distance-based outlier detection. We also present a novel data collection pipeline built atop our detection technique to automatically and iteratively mine unique data samples while discarding erroneous samples. Experiments show that our outlier detection technique is effective at finding errors while our data collection pipeline yields highly diverse corpora that in turn produce more robust intent classification and slot-filling models.",,,
10318045,Identifying Relations for Open Information Extraction,"Open Information Extraction (IE) is the task of extracting assertions from massive corpora without requiring a pre-specified vocabulary. This paper shows that the output of state-ofthe-art Open IE systems is rife with uninformative and incoherent extractions. To overcome these problems, we introduce two simple syntactic and lexical constraints on binary relations expressed by verbs. We implemented the constraints in the REVERB Open IE system, which more than doubles the area under the precision-recall curve relative to previous extractors such as TEXTRUNNER and WOE pos . More than 30% of REVERB's extractions are at precision 0.8 or highercompared to virtually none for earlier systems. The paper concludes with a detailed analysis of REVERB's errors, suggesting directions for future work. 1",,,
104292008,A Target-Agnostic Attack on Deep Models: Exploiting Security Vulnerabilities of Transfer Learning,"Due to the lack of enough training data and high computational cost to train a deep neural network from scratch, transfer learning has been extensively used in many deep-neural-network-based applications, such as face recognition, image classification, speech recognition, etc. A commonly-used transfer learning approach involves taking a part of a pre-trained model, adding a few layers at the end, and re-training the new layers with a small dataset. This approach, while efficient and widely used, imposes a security vulnerability because the pre-trained models used in transfer learning are usually available publicly to everyone, including potential attackers. In this paper, we show that without any additional knowledge other than the pre-trained model, an attacker can launch an effective and efficient brute force attack that can craft instances of input to trigger each target class with high confidence. Note that we assume that the attacker does not have access to any targetspecific information, including samples from target classes, re-trained model, and probabilities assigned by Softmax to each class, and thus called target-agnostic attack. These assumptions render all previous attacks impractical, to the best of our knowledge. To evaluate the proposed attack, we perform a set of experiments on face recognition and speech recognition tasks and show the effectiveness of the attack. Our work sheds light on a fundamental security challenge of transfer learning in deep neural networks.",,,
108308108,ENVIRONMENT PROBING INTERACTION POLICIES,"A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is environment generalization: a policy trained to solve a task in one environment often fails to solve the same task in a slightly different test environment. A common approach to improve interenvironment transfer is to learn policies that are invariant to the distribution of testing environments. However, we argue that instead of being invariant, the policy should identify the specific nuances of an environment and exploit them to achieve better performance. In this work, we propose the ""Environment-Probing"" Interaction (EPI) policy, a policy that probes a new environment to extract an implicit understanding of that environment's behavior. Once this environmentspecific information is obtained, it is used as an additional input to a task-specific policy that can now perform environment-conditioned actions to solve a task. To learn these EPI-policies, we present a reward function based on transition predictability. Specifically, a higher reward is given if the trajectory generated by the EPI-policy can be used to better predict transitions. We experimentally show that EPI-conditioned task-specific policies significantly outperform commonly used policy generalization methods on novel testing environments.",,,
10919200,"The 7th Workshop on the Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications, pages 163-173, On Improving the Accuracy of Readability Classification using Insights from Second Language Acquisition","We investigate the problem of readability assessment using a range of lexical and syntactic features and study their impact on predicting the grade level of texts. As empirical basis, we combined two web-based text sources, Weekly Reader and BBC Bitesize, targeting different age groups, to cover a broad range of school grades. On the conceptual side, we explore the use of lexical and syntactic measures originally designed to measure language development in the production of second language learners. We show that the developmental measures from Second Language Acquisition (SLA) research when combined with traditional readability features such as word length and sentence length provide a good indication of text readability across different grades. The resulting classifiers significantly outperform the previous approaches on readability classification, reaching a classification accuracy of 93.3%.",,,
10961392,Learning from Relatives: Unified Dialectal Arabic Segmentation,"Arabic dialects do not just share a common koiné, but there are shared pandialectal linguistic phenomena that allow computational models for dialects to learn from each other. In this paper we build a unified segmentation model where the training data for different dialects are combined and a single model is trained. The model yields higher accuracies than dialect-specific models, eliminating the need for dialect identification before segmentation. We also measure the degree of relatedness between four major Arabic dialects by testing how a segmentation model trained on one dialect performs on the other dialects. We found that linguistic relatedness is contingent with geographical proximity. In our experiments we use SVM-based ranking and bi-LSTM-CRF sequence labeling.",,,
11128248,Humor Recognition and Humor Anchor Extraction,"Humor is an essential component in personal communication. How to create computational models to discover the structures behind humor, recognize humor and even extract humor anchors remains a challenge.In this work, we first identify several semantic structures behind humor and design sets of features for each structure, and next employ a computational approach to recognize humor. Furthermore, we develop a simple and effective method to extract anchors that enable humor in a sentence. Experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate that our humor recognizer is effective in automatically distinguishing between humorous and non-humorous texts and our extracted humor anchors correlate quite well with human annotations.",,,

12122362,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017 LEARNING TO REMEMBER RARE EVENTS,"Despite recent advances, memory-augmented deep neural networks are still limited when it comes to life-long and one-shot learning, especially in remembering rare events. We present a large-scale life-long memory module for use in deep learning. The module exploits fast nearest-neighbor algorithms for efficiency and thus scales to large memory sizes. Except for the nearest-neighbor query, the module is fully differentiable and trained end-to-end with no extra supervision. It operates in a life-long manner, i.e., without the need to reset it during training. Our memory module can be easily added to any part of a supervised neural network. To show its versatility we add it to a number of networks, from simple convolutional ones tested on image classification to deep sequence-to-sequence and recurrent-convolutional models. In all cases, the enhanced network gains the ability to remember and do life-long one-shot learning. Our module remembers training examples shown many thousands of steps in the past and it can successfully generalize from them. We set new state-of-the-art for one-shot learning on the Omniglot dataset and demonstrate, for the first time, life-long one-shot learning in recurrent neural networks on a large-scale machine translation task. * First two authors contributed equally. † Work done as a member of the Google Brain Residency program (g.co/brainresidency). ‡ Work done during internship at Google Brain.",,,
12160022,A Neural Architecture for Dialectal Arabic Segmentation,"The automated processing of Arabic dialects is challenging due to the lack of spelling standards and the scarcity of annotated data and resources in general. Segmentation of words into their constituent tokens is an important processing step for natural language processing. In this paper, we show how a segmenter can be trained on only 350 annotated tweets using neural networks without any normalization or reliance on lexical features or linguistic resources. We deal with segmentation as a sequence labeling problem at the character level. We show experimentally that our model can rival state-of-the-art methods that heavily depend on additional resources.",,,
12308095,COUNTERING ADVERSARIAL IMAGES USING INPUT TRANSFORMATIONS,"This paper investigates strategies that defend against adversarial-example attacks on image-classification systems by transforming the inputs before feeding them to the system. Specifically, we study applying image transformations such as bit-depth reduction, JPEG compression, total variance minimization, and image quilting before feeding the image to a convolutional network classifier. Our experiments on ImageNet show that total variance minimization and image quilting are very effective defenses in practice, in particular, when the network is trained on transformed images. The strength of those defenses lies in their non-differentiable nature and their inherent randomness, which makes it difficult for an adversary to circumvent the defenses. Our best defense eliminates 60% of strong gray-box and 90% of strong black-box attacks by a variety of major attack methods.",,,
12360898,Cross-Language Text Classification using Structural Correspondence Learning,"We present a new approach to crosslanguage text classification that builds on structural correspondence learning, a recently proposed theory for domain adaptation. The approach uses unlabeled documents, along with a simple word translation oracle, in order to induce taskspecific, cross-lingual word correspondences. We report on analyses that reveal quantitative insights about the use of unlabeled data and the complexity of interlanguage correspondence modeling.We conduct experiments in the field of cross-language sentiment classification, employing English as source language, and German, French, and Japanese as target languages. The results are convincing; they demonstrate both the robustness and the competitiveness of the presented ideas.",,,
12718048,A Syntactic Neural Model for General-Purpose Code Generation,"We consider the problem of parsing natural language descriptions into source code written in a general-purpose programming language like Python. Existing datadriven methods treat this problem as a language generation task without considering the underlying syntax of the target programming language. Informed by previous work in semantic parsing, in this paper we propose a novel neural architecture powered by a grammar model to explicitly capture the target syntax as prior knowledge. Experiments find this an effective way to scale up to generation of complex programs from natural language descriptions, achieving state-of-the-art results that well outperform previous code generation and semantic parsing approaches.",,,
12730344,An Empirical Investigation of Catastrophic Forgetting in Gradient-Based Neural Networks,"Catastrophic forgetting is a problem faced by many machine learning models and algorithms. When trained on one task, then trained on a second task, many machine learning models ""forget"" how to perform the first task. This is widely believed to be a serious problem for neural networks. Here, we investigate the extent to which the catastrophic forgetting problem occurs for modern neural networks, comparing both established and recent gradient-based training algorithms and activation functions. We also examine the effect of the relationship between the first task and the second task on catastrophic forgetting. We find that it is always best to train using the dropout algorithmthe dropout algorithm is consistently best at adapting to the new task, remembering the old task, and has the best tradeoff curve between these two extremes. We find that different tasks and relationships between tasks result in very different rankings of activation function performance. This suggests that the choice of activation function should always be cross-validated.",,,
12734615,Workshop track -ICLR 2017 PARTICLE VALUE FUNCTIONS,"The policy gradients of the expected return objective can react slowly to rare rewards. Yet, in some cases agents may wish to emphasize the low or high returns regardless of their probability. Borrowing from the economics and control literature, we review the risk-sensitive value function that arises from an exponential utility and illustrate its effects on an example. This risk-sensitive value function is not always applicable to reinforcement learning problems, so we introduce the particle value function defined by a particle filter over the distributions of an agent's experience, which bounds the risk-sensitive one. We illustrate the benefit of the policy gradients of this objective in Cliffworld.Stefano Coraluppi. Optimal control of Markov decision processes for performance and robustness. .

1331239,CCGbank: A Corpus of CCG Derivations and Dependency Structures Extracted from the Penn Treebank,"This article presents an algorithm for translating the Penn Treebank into a corpus ofCombinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG)derivations augmented with local and long-range word-word dependencies. The resulting corpus, CCGbank, includes 99.4% of the sentences in the Penn Treebank. It is available from the Linguistic Data Consortium, and has been used to train widecoverage statistical parsers that obtain state-of-the-art rates of dependency recovery.In order to obtain linguistically adequate CCG analyses, and to eliminate noise and inconsistencies in the original annotation, an extensive analysis of the constructions and annotations in the Penn Treebank was called for, and a substantial number of changes to the Treebank were necessary. We discuss the implications of our findings for the extraction of other linguistically expressive grammars from the Treebank, and for the design of future treebanks.subcorpus of Wall Street Journal text that has become the de facto standard training and test data for statistical parsers. Its annotation, which is based on generic phrasestructure grammar (with coindexed traces and other null elements indicating non-local dependencies) and function tags on nonterminal categories providing (a limited degree of) syntactic role information, is designed to facilitate the extraction of the underlying predicate-argument structure. Statistical parsing on the Penn Treebank has made great progress by focusing on the machine-learning or algorithmic aspects(Magerman 1994;",,,

In this paper, we explore automating algorithm design and present a method to learn an optimization algorithm, which we believe to be the first method that can automatically discover a better algorithm. We approach this problem from a reinforcement learning perspective and represent any particular optimization algorithm as a policy. We learn an optimization algorithm using guided policy search and demonstrate that the resulting algorithm outperforms existing hand-engineered algorithms in terms of convergence speed and/or the final objective value.",,,
13468104,WORD REPRESENTATIONS VIA GAUSSIAN EMBEDDING,"Current work in lexical distributed representations maps each word to a point vector in low-dimensional space. Mapping instead to a density provides many interesting advantages, including better capturing uncertainty about a representation and its relationships, expressing asymmetries more naturally than dot product or cosine similarity, and enabling more expressive parameterization of decision boundaries. This paper advocates for density-based distributed embeddings and presents a method for learning representations in the space of Gaussian distributions. We compare performance on various word embedding benchmarks, investigate the ability of these embeddings to model entailment and other asymmetric relationships, and explore novel properties of the representation.",,,
13495961,A Character-Level Decoder without Explicit Segmentation for Neural Machine Translation,"The existing machine translation systems, whether phrase-based or neural, have relied almost exclusively on word-level modelling with explicit segmentation. In this paper, we ask a fundamental question: can neural machine translation generate a character sequence without any explicit segmentation? To answer this question, we evaluate an attention-based encoderdecoder with a subword-level encoder and a character-level decoder on four language pairs-En-Cs, En-De, En-Ru and En-Fiusing the parallel corpora from WMT'15. Our experiments show that the models with a character-level decoder outperform the ones with a subword-level decoder on all of the four language pairs. Furthermore, the ensembles of neural models with a character-level decoder outperform the state-of-the-art non-neural machine translation systems on En-Cs, En-De and En-Fi and perform comparably on En-Ru.",,,
13900194,Certifying Some Distributional Robustness with Principled Adversarial Training,"Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples and researchers have proposed many heuristic attack and defense mechanisms. We address this problem through the principled lens of distributionally robust optimization, which guarantees performance under adversarial input perturbations. By considering a Lagrangian penalty formulation of perturbing the underlying data distribution in a Wasserstein ball, we provide a training procedure that augments model parameter updates with worst-case perturbations of training data. For smooth losses, our procedure provably achieves moderate levels of robustness with little computational or statistical cost relative to empirical risk minimization. Furthermore, our statistical guarantees allow us to efficiently certify robustness for the population loss. For imperceptible perturbations, our method matches or outperforms heuristic approaches.* Equal contribution 1 Note that z, u ∈ R m , so trivially the dimensionality of the solution grows polynomially.2We assume that X is a subset of normed vector space.",,,
14096841,AN ACTOR-CRITIC ALGORITHM FOR SEQUENCE PREDICTION,"We present an approach to training neural networks to generate sequences using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning (RL). Current log-likelihood training methods are limited by the discrepancy between their training and testing modes, as models must generate tokens conditioned on their previous guesses rather than the ground-truth tokens. We address this problem by introducing a critic network that is trained to predict the value of an output token, given the policy of an actor network. This results in a training procedure that is much closer to the test phase, and allows us to directly optimize for a task-specific score such as BLEU. Crucially, since we leverage these techniques in the supervised learning setting rather than the traditional RL setting, we condition the critic network on the ground-truth output. We show that our method leads to improved performance on both a synthetic task, and for German-English machine translation. Our analysis paves the way for such methods to be applied in natural language generation tasks, such as machine translation, caption generation, and dialogue modelling. * CIFAR Senior Fellow † CIFAR Fellow Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017 from a sampled prediction lead to a high task-specific score, such as BLEU(Papineni et al., 2002)or ROUGE (Lin & Hovy, 2003).In this work, we propose and study an alternative procedure for training sequence prediction networks that aims to directly improve their test time metrics (which are typically not the log-likelihood). In particular, we train an additional network called the critic to output the value of each token, which we define as the expected task-specific score that the network will receive if it outputs the token and continues to sample outputs according to its probability distribution. Furthermore, we show how the predicted values can be used to train the main sequence prediction network, which we refer to as the actor. The theoretical foundation of our method is that, under the assumption that the critic computes exact values, the expression that we use to train the actor is an unbiased estimate of the gradient of the expected task-specific score.Our approach draws inspiration and borrows the terminology from the field of reinforcement learning (RL)(Sutton & Barto, 1998), in particular from the actor-critic approach(Sutton, 1984;Sutton et al., 1999;Barto et al., 1983). RL studies the problem of acting efficiently based only on weak supervision in the form of a reward given for some of the agent's actions. In our case, the reward is analogous to the task-specific score associated with a prediction. However, the tasks we consider are those of supervised learning, and we make use of this crucial difference by allowing the critic to use the ground-truth answer as an input. In other words, the critic has access to a sequence of expert actions that are known to lead to high (or even optimal) returns. To train the critic, we adapt the temporal difference methods from the RL literature(Sutton, 1988)to our setup. While RL methods with non-linear function approximators are not new(Tesauro, 1994;Miller et al., 1995), they have recently surged in popularity, giving rise to the field of 'deep RL'(Mnih et al., 2015). We show that some of the techniques recently developed in deep RL, such as having a target network, may also be beneficial for sequence prediction.The contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows: 1) we describe how RL methodology like the actor-critic approach can be applied to supervised learning problems with structured outputs; and 2) we investigate the performance and behavior of the new method on both a synthetic task and a real-world task of machine translation, demonstrating the improvements over maximum-likelihood and REINFORCE brought by the actor-critic training.",,,
14228101,Big Neural Networks Waste Capacity,"This article exposes the failure of some big neural networks to leverage added capacity to reduce underfitting. Past research suggest diminishing returns when increasing the size of neural networks. Our experiments on ImageNet LSVRC-2010 show that this may be due to the fact there are highly diminishing returns for capacity in terms of training error, leading to underfitting. This suggests that the optimization method -first order gradient descent -fails at this regime. Directly attacking this problem, either through the optimization method or the choices of parametrization, may allow to improve the generalization error on large datasets, for which a large capacity is required.",,,
14498604,Auto-pooling: Learning to Improve Invariance of Image Features from Image Sequences,"Learning invariant representations from images is one of the hardest challenges facing computer vision. Spatial pooling is widely used to create invariance to spatial shifting, but it is restricted to convolutional models. In this paper, we propose a novel pooling method that can learn soft clustering of features from image sequences. It is trained to improve the temporal coherence of features, while keeping the information loss at minimum. Our method does not use spatial information, so it can be used with non-convolutional models too. Experiments on images extracted from natural videos showed that our method can cluster similar features together. When trained by convolutional features, auto-pooling outperformed traditional spatial pooling on an image classification task, even though it does not use the spatial topology of features.",,,
14515265,Predicting Native Language from Gaze,"A fundamental question in language learning concerns the role of a speaker's first language in second language acquisition. We present a novel methodology for studying this question: analysis of eye-movement patterns in second language reading of free-form text. Using this methodology, we demonstrate for the first time that the native language of English learners can be predicted from their gaze fixations when reading English. We provide analysis of classifier uncertainty and learned features, which indicates that differences in English reading are likely to be rooted in linguistic divergences across native languages. The presented framework complements production studies and offers new ground for advancing research on multilingualism. 1",,,
14717992,REINFORCEMENT LEARNING WITH UNSUPERVISED AUXILIARY TASKS,"Deep reinforcement learning agents have achieved state-of-the-art results by directly maximising cumulative reward. However, environments contain a much wider variety of possible training signals. In this paper, we introduce an agent that also maximises many other pseudo-reward functions simultaneously by reinforcement learning. All of these tasks share a common representation that, like unsupervised learning, continues to develop in the absence of extrinsic rewards. We also introduce a novel mechanism for focusing this representation upon extrinsic rewards, so that learning can rapidly adapt to the most relevant aspects of the actual task. Our agent significantly outperforms the previous state-of-theart on Atari, averaging 880% expert human performance, and a challenging suite of first-person, three-dimensional Labyrinth tasks leading to a mean speedup in learning of 10× and averaging 87% expert human performance on Labyrinth.Natural and artificial agents live in a stream of sensorimotor data. At each time step t, the agent receives observations o t and executes actions a t . These actions influence the future course of the sensorimotor stream. In this paper we develop agents that learn to predict and control this stream, by solving a host of reinforcement learning problems, each focusing on a distinct feature of the sensorimotor stream. Our hypothesis is that an agent that can flexibly control its future experiences will also be able to achieve any goal with which it is presented, such as maximising its future rewards.The classic reinforcement learning paradigm focuses on the maximisation of extrinsic reward. However, in many interesting domains, extrinsic rewards are only rarely observed. This raises questions of what and how to learn in their absence. Even if extrinsic rewards are frequent, the sensorimotor stream contains an abundance of other possible learning targets. Traditionally, unsupervised learning attempts to reconstruct these targets, such as the pixels in the current or subsequent frame. It is typically used to accelerate the acquisition of a useful representation. In contrast, our learning objective is to predict and control features of the sensorimotor stream, by treating them as pseudorewards for reinforcement learning. Intuitively, this set of tasks is more closely matched with the agent's long-term goals, potentially leading to more useful representations.Consider a baby that learns to maximise the cumulative amount of red that it observes. To correctly predict the optimal value, the baby must understand how to increase ""redness"" by various means, including manipulation (bringing a red object closer to the eyes); locomotion (moving in front of a red object); and communication (crying until the parents bring a red object). These behaviours are likely to recur for many other goals that the baby may subsequently encounter. No understanding of these behaviours is required to simply reconstruct the redness of current or subsequent images.Our architecture uses reinforcement learning to approximate both the optimal policy and optimal value function for many different pseudo-rewards. It also makes other auxiliary predictions that serve to focus the agent on important aspects of the task. These include the long-term goal of predicting cumulative extrinsic reward as well as short-term predictions of extrinsic reward. To learn more efficiently, our agents use an experience replay mechanism to provide additional updates * Joint first authors. Ordered alphabetically by first name.",,,
14724343,THIRD-PERSON IMITATION LEARNING,"Reinforcement learning (RL) makes it possible to train agents capable of achieving sophisticated goals in complex and uncertain environments. A key difficulty in reinforcement learning is specifying a reward function for the agent to optimize. Traditionally, imitation learning in RL has been used to overcome this problem. Unfortunately, hitherto imitation learning methods tend to require that demonstrations are supplied in the first-person: the agent is provided with a sequence of states and a specification of the actions that it should have taken. While powerful, this kind of imitation learning is limited by the relatively hard problem of collecting first-person demonstrations. Humans address this problem by learning from third-person demonstrations: they observe other humans perform tasks, infer the task, and accomplish the same task themselves. In this paper, we present a method for unsupervised third-person imitation learning. Here third-person refers to training an agent to correctly achieve a simple goal in a simple environment when it is provided a demonstration of a teacher achieving the same goal but from a different viewpoint; and unsupervised refers to the fact that the agent receives only these third-person demonstrations, and is not provided a correspondence between teacher states and student states. Our methods primary insight is that recent advances from domain confusion can be utilized to yield domain agnostic features which are crucial during the training process. To validate our approach, we report successful experiments on learning from third-person demonstrations in a pointmass domain, a reacher domain, and inverted pendulum.",,,
14764893,Identifying Appropriate Support for Propositions in Online User Comments,"The ability to analyze the adequacy of supporting information is necessary for determining the strength of an argument. 1 This is especially the case for online user comments, which often consist of arguments lacking proper substantiation and reasoning. Thus, we develop a framework for automatically classifying each proposition as UNVERIFIABLE, VERIFIABLE NON-EXPERIENTIAL, or VERIFIABLE EXPE-RIENTIAL 2 , where the appropriate type of support is reason, evidence, and optional evidence, respectively 3 . Once the existing support for propositions are identified, this classification can provide an estimate of how adequately the arguments have been supported. We build a goldstandard dataset of 9,476 sentences and clauses from 1,047 comments submitted to an eRulemaking platform and find that Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers trained with n-grams and additional features capturing the verifiability and experientiality exhibit statistically significant improvement over the unigram baseline, achieving a macro-averaged F 1 of 68.99%.",,,
15280949,A STRUCTURED SELF-ATTENTIVE SENTENCE EMBEDDING,"This paper proposes a new model for extracting an interpretable sentence embedding by introducing self-attention. Instead of using a vector, we use a 2-D matrix to represent the embedding, with each row of the matrix attending on a different part of the sentence. We also propose a self-attention mechanism and a special regularization term for the model. As a side effect, the embedding comes with an easy way of visualizing what specific parts of the sentence are encoded into the embedding. We evaluate our model on 3 different tasks: author profiling, sentiment classification and textual entailment. Results show that our model yields a significant performance gain compared to other sentence embedding methods in all of the 3 tasks. * This work has been done during the 1st author's internship with IBM Watson.",,,
15323440,REPRESENTATION USING THE WEYL TRANSFORM,"The Weyl transform is introduced as a powerful framework for representing measurement data. Transform coefficients are connected to the Walsh-Hadamard transform of multiscale autocorrelations, and different forms of dyadic periodicity in a signal are shown to appear as different features in its Weyl coefficients. A large group of multiscale transformations is shown to support very fast pooling since the Weyl coefficients are unique up to permutation and phase changes when the original signal is transformed by any element of this group. The effectiveness of the Weyl transform is demonstrated through the example of textured image classification. * Q. Qiu and A. Thompson contributed equally to this work.",,,
155089628,"When a Good Translation is Wrong in Context: Context-Aware Machine Translation Improves on Deixis, Ellipsis, and Lexical Cohesion","Though machine translation errors caused by the lack of context beyond one sentence have long been acknowledged, the development of context-aware NMT systems is hampered by several problems. Firstly, standard metrics are not sensitive to improvements in consistency in document-level translations. Secondly, previous work on context-aware NMT assumed that the sentence-aligned parallel data consisted of complete documents while in most practical scenarios such document-level data constitutes only a fraction of the available parallel data. To address the first issue, we perform a human study on an English-Russian subtitles dataset and identify deixis, ellipsis and lexical cohesion as three main sources of inconsistency. We then create test sets targeting these phenomena. To address the second shortcoming, we consider a set-up in which a much larger amount of sentence-level data is available compared to that aligned at the document level. We introduce a model that is suitable for this scenario and demonstrate major gains over a context-agnostic baseline on our new benchmarks without sacrificing performance as measured with BLEU. 1",,,

15859165,Geolocation Prediction in Social Media Data by Finding Location Indicative Words,"Geolocation prediction is vital to geospatial applications like localised search and local event detection. Predominately, social media geolocation models are based on full text data, including common words with no geospatial dimension (e.g. today) and noisy strings (tmrw), potentially hampering prediction and leading to slower/more memory-intensive models. In this paper, we focus on finding location indicative words (LIWs) via feature selection, and establishing whether the reduced feature set boosts geolocation accuracy. Our results show that an information gain ratiobased approach surpasses other methods at LIW selection, outperforming state-of-the-art geolocation prediction methods by 10.6% in accuracy and reducing the mean and median of prediction error distance by 45km and 209km, respectively, on a public dataset. We further formulate notions of prediction confidence, and demonstrate that performance is even higher in cases where our model is more confident, striking a trade-off between accuracy and coverage. Finally, the identified LIWs reveal regional language differences, which could be potentially useful for lexicographers.",,,

16134629,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017 LEARNING TO ACT BY PREDICTING THE FUTURE,"We present an approach to sensorimotor control in immersive environments. Our approach utilizes a high-dimensional sensory stream and a lower-dimensional measurement stream. The cotemporal structure of these streams provides a rich supervisory signal, which enables training a sensorimotor control model by interacting with the environment. The model is trained using supervised learning techniques, but without extraneous supervision. It learns to act based on raw sensory input from a complex three-dimensional environment. The presented formulation enables learning without a fixed goal at training time, and pursuing dynamically changing goals at test time. We conduct extensive experiments in threedimensional simulations based on the classical first-person game Doom. The results demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms sophisticated prior formulations, particularly on challenging tasks. The results also show that trained models successfully generalize across environments and goals. A model trained using the presented approach won the Full Deathmatch track of the Visual Doom AI Competition, which was held in previously unseen environments.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017 vided by experience itself: by acting and observing the effects of different actions in the context of changing sensory inputs and goals.",,,

A postediting phase is required to improve the output of a machine translation system. An alternative is the so called computerassisted translation. In this framework, a human translator interacts with the system in order to obtain high-quality translations. A statistical phrase-based approach to computer-assisted translation is described in this article.

16672277,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2016 PREDICTING DISTRIBUTIONS WITH LINEARIZING BELIEF NETWORKS,"Conditional belief networks introduce stochastic binary variables in neural networks. Contrary to a classical neural network, a belief network can predict more than the expected value of the output Y given the input X. It can predict a distribution of outputs Y which is useful when an input can admit multiple outputs whose average is not necessarily a valid answer. Such networks are particularly relevant to inverse problems such as image prediction for denoising, or text to speech. However, traditional sigmoid belief networks are hard to train and are not suited to continuous problems. This work introduces a new family of networks called linearizing belief nets or LBNs. A LBN decomposes into a deep linear network where each linear unit can be turned on or off by non-deterministic binary latent units. It is a universal approximator of real-valued conditional distributions and can be trained using gradient descent. Moreover, the linear pathways efficiently propagate continuous information and they act as multiplicative skip-connections that help optimization by removing gradient diffusion. This yields a model which trains efficiently and improves the state-of-the-art on image denoising and facial expression generation with the Toronto faces dataset.",,,
16716473,Modeling correlations in spontaneous activity of visual cortex with centered Gaussian-binary deep Boltzmann machines,"Spontaneous cortical activity -the ongoing cortical activities in absence of intentional sensory input -is considered to play a vital role in many aspects of both normal brain functions [1] and mental dysfunctions[2]. We present a centered Gaussian-binary Deep Boltzmann Machine (GDBM) for modeling the spontaneous activity in early cortical visual area and relate the random sampling in GDBMs to the spontaneous cortical activity. After training the proposed model on natural image patches, we show that the samples collected from the model's probability distribution encompass similar activity patterns as found in the spontaneous activity. Specifically, filters having the same orientation preference tend to be active together during random sampling. Our work demonstrates GDBM is a meaningful model approach for basic receptive field properties and the emergence of spontaneous activity patterns in early cortical visual areas. Besides, we show empirically that centered GDBMs do not suffer from the difficulties during training as GDBMs do and can be properly trained without the layer-wise pretraining as described in[3].",,,
167217322,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 NETWORK DECONVOLUTION,"Convolution is a central operation in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which applies a kernel to overlapping regions shifted across the image. However, because of the strong correlations in real-world image data, convolutional kernels are in effect re-learning redundant data. In this work, we show that this redundancy has made neural network training challenging, and propose network deconvolution, a procedure which optimally removes pixel-wise and channel-wise correlations before the data is fed into each layer. Network deconvolution can be efficiently calculated at a fraction of the computational cost of a convolution layer. We also show that the deconvolution filters in the first layer of the network resemble the center-surround structure found in biological neurons in the visual regions of the brain. Filtering with such kernels results in a sparse representation, a desired property that has been missing in the training of neural networks. Learning from the sparse representation promotes faster convergence and superior results without the use of batch normalization. We apply our network deconvolution operation to 10 modern neural network models by replacing batch normalization within each. Extensive experiments show that the network deconvolution operation is able to deliver performance improvement in all cases on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,",,,

Our model scores extraction sets: nested collections of all the overlapping phrase pairs consistent with an underlying word alignment. Extraction set models provide two principle advantages over word-factored alignment models. First, we can incorporate features on phrase pairs, in addition to word links. Second, we can optimize for an extraction-based loss function that relates directly to the end task of generating translations. Our model gives improvements in alignment quality relative to state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised baselines, as well as providing up to a 1.4 improvement in BLEU score in Chinese-to-English translation experiments.",,,
1675452,Neural Semantic Parsing with Type Constraints for Semi-Structured Tables,"We present a new semantic parsing model for answering compositional questions on semi-structured Wikipedia tables. Our parser is an encoder-decoder neural network with two key technical innovations:(1) a grammar for the decoder that only generates well-typed logical forms; and (2) an entity embedding and linking module that identifies entity mentions while generalizing across tables. We also introduce a novel method for training our neural model with question-answer supervision. On the WIKITABLEQUESTIONS data set, our parser achieves a state-of-theart accuracy of 43.3% for a single model and 45.9% for a 5-model ensemble, improving on the best prior score of 38.7% set by a 15-model ensemble.

We formulate an entropy-like functional on positive definite matrices based on Renyi's axiomatic definition of entropy and examine some key properties of this functional that lead to the concept of infinite divisibility. The proposed formulation avoids the plug in estimation of density and brings along the representation power of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. As an application example, we derive a supervised metric learning algorithm using a matrix based analogue to conditional entropy achieving results comparable with the state of the art.",,,
16911296,Sequence-based Structured Prediction for Semantic Parsing,"We propose an approach for semantic parsing that uses a recurrent neural network to map a natural language question into a logical form representation of a KB query. Building on recent work by(Wang et al., 2015), the interpretable logical forms, which are structured objects obeying certain constraints, are enumerated by an underlying grammar and are paired with their canonical realizations. In order to use sequence prediction, we need to sequentialize these logical forms. We compare three sequentializations: a direct linearization of the logical form, a linearization of the associated canonical realization, and a sequence consisting of derivation steps relative to the underlying grammar. We also show how grammatical constraints on the derivation sequence can easily be integrated inside the RNNbased sequential predictor. Our experiments show important improvements over previous results for the same dataset, and also demonstrate the advantage of incorporating the grammatical constraints.",,,

Similarly to other multi-word expressions, particle verbs exhibit various levels of compositionality. One of the major obstacles for the study of compositionality is the lack of representative gold standards of human ratings. In order to address this bottleneck, this paper presents such a gold standard data set containing 400 randomly selected German particle verbs. It is balanced across several particle types and three frequency bands, and accomplished by human ratings on the degree of semantic compositionality.",,,

For that reason, many social media services address the problem of identifying hate speech, but the definition of hate speech varies markedly and is largely a manual effort(BBC, 2015;Lomas, 2015).We provide a list of criteria founded in critical race theory, and use them to annotate a publicly available corpus of more than 16k tweets.

Furthermore, we propose connectionist bi-directional recurrent neural networks and introduce ranking loss for their optimization.

173611,A Classifier-Based Parser with Linear Run-Time Complexity,"We present a classifier-based parser that produces constituent trees in linear time. The parser uses a basic bottom-up shiftreduce algorithm, but employs a classifier to determine parser actions instead of a grammar. This can be seen as an extension of the deterministic dependency parser ofNivre and Scholz (2004)to full constituent parsing. We show that, with an appropriate feature set used in classification, a very simple one-path greedy parser can perform at the same level of accuracy as more complex parsers. We evaluate our parser on section 23 of the WSJ section of the Penn Treebank, and obtain precision and recall of 87.54% and 87.61%, respectively.",,,
173990671,SpikeGrad: An ANN-equivalent Computation Model for Implementing Backpropagation with Spikes,"Event-based neuromorphic systems promise to reduce the energy consumption of deep learning tasks by replacing expensive floating point operations on dense matrices by low power sparse and asynchronous operations on spike events. While these systems can be trained increasingly well using approximations of the backpropagation algorithm, these implementations usually require high precision errors for training and are therefore incompatible with the typical communication infrastructure of neuromorphic circuits. In this work, we analyze how the gradient can be discretized into spike events when training a spiking neural network. To accelerate our simulation, we show that using a special implementation of the integrate-andfire neuron allows us to describe the accumulated activations and errors of the spiking neural network in terms of an equivalent artificial neural network, allowing us to largely speed up training compared to an explicit simulation of all spike events. This way we are able to demonstrate that even for deep networks, the gradients can be discretized sufficiently well with spikes if the gradient is properly rescaled. This form of spike-based backpropagation enables us to achieve equivalent or better accuracies on the MNIST and CIFAR10 dataset than comparable state-of-the-art spiking neural networks trained with full precision gradients. The algorithm, which we call SpikeGrad, is based on accumulation and comparison operations and can naturally exploit sparsity in the gradient computation, which makes it an interesting choice for a spiking neuromorphic systems with on-chip learning capacities.Preprint.

174797767,Disentangling neural mechanisms for perceptual grouping,"Forming perceptual groups and individuating objects in visual scenes is an essential step towards visual intelligence. This ability is thought to arise in the brain from computations implemented by bottom-up, horizontal, and top-down connections between neurons. However, the relative contributions of these connections to perceptual grouping are poorly understood. We address this question by systematically evaluating neural network architectures featuring combinations of these connections on two synthetic visual tasks, which stress low-level ""gestalt"" vs. high-level object cues for perceptual grouping. We show that increasing the difficulty of either task strains learning for networks that rely solely on bottom-up processing. Horizontal connections resolve this limitation on tasks with gestalt cues by supporting incremental spatial propagation of activities, whereas top-down connections rescue learning on tasks featuring object cues by propagating coarse predictions about the position of the target object. Our findings disassociate the computational roles of bottom-up, horizontal and top-down connectivity, and demonstrate how a model featuring all of these interactions can more flexibly learn to form perceptual groups.Extant theory suggests that there are two distinct types of feedback strategies: A low-level strategy of grouping visual features with neighboring features according to Gestalt laws including similarity, good continuation, etc.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19]. In contrast, an object-based strategy is mediated by expectations † These authors contributed equally to this work.",,,
174798321,Training Neural Machine Translation To Apply Terminology Constraints,"This paper proposes a novel method to inject custom terminology into neural machine translation at run time. Previous works have mainly proposed modifications to the decoding algorithm in order to constrain the output to include run-time-provided target terms. While being effective, these constrained decoding methods add, however, significant computational overhead to the inference step, and, as we show in this paper, can be brittle when tested in realistic conditions. In this paper we approach the problem by training a neural MT system to learn how to use custom terminology when provided with the input. Comparative experiments show that our method is not only more effective than a state-of-the-art implementation of constrained decoding, but is also as fast as constraint-free decoding.",,,
174800300,"Partial Or Complete, That Is The Question","For many structured learning tasks, the data annotation process is complex and costly. Existing annotation schemes usually aim at acquiring completely annotated structures, under the common perception that partial structures are of low quality and could hurt the learning process. This paper questions this common perception, motivated by the fact that structures consist of interdependent sets of variables. Thus, given a fixed budget, partly annotating each structure may provide the same level of supervision, while allowing for more structures to be annotated. We provide an information theoretic formulation for this perspective and use it, in the context of three diverse structured learning tasks, to show that learning from partial structures can sometimes outperform learning from complete ones. Our findings may provide important insights into structured data annotation schemes and could support progress in learning protocols for structured tasks.",,,
174801080,Multi-hop Reading Comprehension through Question Decomposition and Rescoring,"Multi-hop Reading Comprehension (RC) requires reasoning and aggregation across several paragraphs. We propose a system for multi-hop RC that decomposes a compositional question into simpler sub-questions that can be answered by off-the-shelf single-hop RC models. Since annotations for such decomposition are expensive, we recast subquestion generation as a span prediction problem and show that our method, trained using only 400 labeled examples, generates sub-questions that are as effective as humanauthored sub-questions. We also introduce a new global rescoring approach that considers each decomposition (i.e. the sub-questions and their answers) to select the best final answer, greatly improving overall performance. Our experiments on HOTPOTQA show that this approach achieves the state-of-the-art results, while providing explainable evidence for its decision making in the form of sub-questions. . 2018.

174801567,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 PLAYING THE LOTTERY WITH REWARDS AND MULTIPLE LANGUAGES: LOTTERY TICKETS IN RL AND NLP,"The lottery ticket hypothesis proposes that over-parameterization of deep neural networks (DNNs) aids training by increasing the probability of a ""lucky"" sub-network initialization being present rather than by helping the optimization process (Frankle & Carbin, 2019). Intriguingly, this phenomenon suggests that initialization strategies for DNNs can be improved substantially, but the lottery ticket hypothesis has only previously been tested in the context of supervised learning for natural image tasks. Here, we evaluate whether ""winning ticket"" initializations exist in two different domains: natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning (RL). For NLP, we examined both recurrent LSTM models and large-scale Transformer models(Vaswani et al., 2017). For RL, we analyzed a number of discrete-action space tasks, including both classic control and pixel control. Consistent with work in supervised image classification, we confirm that winning ticket initializations generally outperform parameter-matched random initializations, even at extreme pruning rates for both NLP and RL. Notably, we are able to find winning ticket initializations for Transformers which enable models one-third the size to achieve nearly equivalent performance. Together, these results suggest that the lottery ticket hypothesis is not restricted to supervised learning of natural images, but rather represents a broader phenomenon in DNNs.",,,

17711681,MAXIMUM ENTROPY FLOW NETWORKS,"Maximum entropy modeling is a flexible and popular framework for formulating statistical models given partial knowledge. In this paper, rather than the traditional method of optimizing over the continuous density directly, we learn a smooth and invertible transformation that maps a simple distribution to the desired maximum entropy distribution. Doing so is nontrivial in that the objective being maximized (entropy) is a function of the density itself. By exploiting recent developments in normalizing flow networks, we cast the maximum entropy problem into a finite-dimensional constrained optimization, and solve the problem by combining stochastic optimization with the augmented Lagrangian method. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and applications to finance and computer vision show the flexibility and accuracy of using maximum entropy flow networks. * These authors contributed equally.",,,
1774259,Bidirectional Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network for Relation Classification,"Relation classification is an important semantic processing task in the field of natural language processing (NLP). In this paper, we present a novel model BRCNN to classify the relation of two entities in a sentence. Some state-of-the-art systems concentrate on modeling the shortest dependency path (SDP) between two entities leveraging convolutional or recurrent neural networks. We further explore how to make full use of the dependency relations information in the SDP, by combining convolutional neural networks and twochannel recurrent neural networks with long short term memory (LSTM) units. We propose a bidirectional architecture to learn relation representations with directional information along the SDP forwards and backwards at the same time, which benefits classifying the direction of relations.

17801454,Factorial Hidden Markov Models for Learning Representations of Natural Language,"Most representation learning algorithms for language and image processing are local, in that they identify features for a data point based on surrounding points. Yet in language processing, the correct meaning of a word often depends on its global context. As a step toward incorporating global context into representation learning, we develop a representation learning algorithm that incorporates joint prediction into its technique for producing features for a word. We develop efficient variational methods for learning Factorial Hidden Markov Models from large texts, and use variational distributions to produce features for each word that are sensitive to the entire input sequence, not just to a local context window. Experiments on part-of-speech tagging and chunking indicate that the features are competitive with or better than existing state-of-the-art representation learning methods.",,,

In particular, connectives are employed to directly represent the hierarchy of the tree structure and the rhetorical relation of a discourse, while the nuclei of discourse units are globally determined with reference to the dependency theory. Guided by the CDT scheme, we manually annotate a Chinese Discourse Treebank (CDTB) of 500 documents. Preliminary evaluation justifies the appropriateness of the CDT scheme to Chinese discourse analysis and the usefulness of our manually annotated CDTB corpus.",,,

The ECB corpus is one of the data sets used for evaluation of the task of event coreference resolution. Our analysis shows that the ECB in most cases covers one seminal event per domain, what considerably simplifies event and so language diversity that one comes across in the news. We augmented the corpus with a new corpus component, consisting of 502 texts, describing different instances of event types that were already captured by the 43 topics of the ECB, making it more representative of news articles on the web.

182952687,"WATCH, TRY, LEARN: META-LEARNING FROM DEMONSTRATIONS AND REWARDS","Imitation learning allows agents to learn complex behaviors from demonstrations. However, learning a complex vision-based task may require an impractical number of demonstrations. Meta-imitation learning is a promising approach towards enabling agents to learn a new task from one or a few demonstrations by leveraging experience from learning similar tasks. In the presence of task ambiguity or unobserved dynamics, demonstrations alone may not provide enough information; an agent must also try the task to successfully infer a policy. In this work, we propose a method that can learn to learn from both demonstrations and trial-anderror experience with sparse reward feedback. In comparison to meta-imitation, this approach enables the agent to effectively and efficiently improve itself autonomously beyond the demonstration data. In comparison to meta-reinforcement learning, we can scale to substantially broader distributions of tasks, as the demonstration reduces the burden of exploration. Our experiments show that our method significantly outperforms prior approaches on a set of challenging, vision-based control tasks.",,,
182953182,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 FOUR THINGS EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW TO IMPROVE BATCH NORMALIZATION,"A key component of most neural network architectures is the use of normalization layers, such as Batch Normalization. Despite its common use and large utility in optimizing deep architectures, it has been challenging both to generically improve upon Batch Normalization and to understand the circumstances that lend themselves to other enhancements. In this paper, we identify four improvements to the generic form of Batch Normalization and the circumstances under which they work, yielding performance gains across all batch sizes while requiring no additional computation during training. These contributions include proposing a method for reasoning about the current example in inference normalization statistics, fixing a training vs. inference discrepancy; recognizing and validating the powerful regularization effect of Ghost Batch Normalization for small and medium batch sizes; examining the effect of weight decay regularization on the scaling and shifting parameters γ and β; and identifying a new normalization algorithm for very small batch sizes by combining the strengths of Batch and Group Normalization.

18323900,Bounding the Test Log-Likelihood of Generative Models,"Several interesting generative learning algorithms involve a complex probability distribution over many random variables, involving intractable normalization constants or latent variable marginalization. Some of them may not have even an analytic expression for the unnormalized probability function and no tractable approximation. This makes it difficult to estimate the quality of these models, once they have been trained, or to monitor their quality (e.g. for early stopping) while training. A previously proposed method is based on constructing a non-parametric density estimator of the model's probability function from samples generated by the model. We revisit this idea, propose a more efficient estimator, and prove that it provides a lower bound on the true test log-likelihood and an unbiased estimator as the number of generated samples goes to infinity, although one that incorporates the effect of poor mixing. We further propose a biased variant of the estimator that can be used reliably with a finite number of samples for the purpose of model comparison.",,,

Those properties follow from some conditions (i.e., completeness and decomposability) that must be respected by the structure of the network. As a result, it is not easy to specify a valid sum-product network by hand and therefore structure learning techniques are typically used in practice. This paper describes the first online structure learning technique for continuous SPNs with Gaussian leaves. We also introduce an accompanying new parameter learning technique.",,,

In this paper, we propose an alternative method that is more efficient than prior work and produces representations that have a property we call focality -a property we hypothesize to be important for neural network representations.

(2014)on recurrent neural models for attention into less constrained visual environments, beginning with fine-grained categorization on the Stanford Dogs data set. In this work we use an RNN of the same structure but substitute a more powerful visual network and perform large-scale pre-training of the visual network outside of the attention RNN. Most work in attention models to date focuses on tasks with toy or more constrained visual environments. We present competitive results for finegrained categorization. More importantly, we show that our model learns to direct high resolution attention to the most discriminative regions without any spatial supervision such as bounding boxes. Given a small input window, it is hence able to discriminate fine-grained dog breeds with cheap glances at faces and fur patterns, while avoiding expensive and distracting processing of entire images. In addition to allowing high resolution processing with a fixed budget and naturally handling static or sequential inputs, this approach has the major advantage of being trained end-to-end, unlike most current approaches which are heavily engineered.",,,

189856873,Towards Stable and Efficient Training of Verifiably Robust Neural Networks,"Training neural networks with verifiable robustness guarantees is challenging. Several existing approaches utilize linear relaxation based neural network output bounds under perturbation, but they can slow down training by a factor of hundreds depending on the underlying network architectures. Meanwhile, interval bound propagation (IBP) based training is efficient and significantly outperforms linear relaxation based methods on many tasks, yet it may suffer from stability issues since the bounds are much looser especially at the beginning of training. In this paper, we propose a new certified adversarial training method, CROWN-IBP, by combining the fast IBP bounds in a forward bounding pass and a tight linear relaxation based bound, CROWN, in a backward bounding pass. CROWN-IBP is computationally efficient and consistently outperforms IBP baselines on training verifiably robust neural networks. We conduct large scale experiments on MNIST and CIFAR datasets, and outperform all previous linear relaxation and bound propagation based certified defenses in ∞ robustness.

189999405,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 LEARNING EXECUTION THROUGH NEURAL CODE FUSION,"As the performance of computer systems stagnates due to the end of Moore's Law, there is a need for new models that can understand and optimize the execution of general purpose code. While there is a growing body of work on using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn static representations of source code, these representations do not understand how code executes at runtime. In this work, we propose a new approach using GNNs to learn fused representations of general source code and its execution. Our approach defines a multi-task GNN over low-level representations of source code and program state (i.e., assembly code and dynamic memory states), converting complex source code constructs and data structures into a simpler, more uniform format. We show that this leads to improved performance over similar methods that do not use execution and it opens the door to applying GNN models to new tasks that would not be feasible from static code alone. As an illustration of this, we apply the new model to challenging dynamic tasks (branch prediction and prefetching) from the SPEC CPU benchmark suite, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 26% and 45% respectively. Moreover, we use the learned fused graph embeddings to demonstrate transfer learning with high performance on an indirectly related algorithm classification task. * Work completed during an internship at Google. 1 As Moore's Law ends, prediction techniques in these fields have also stagnated. For example, the winner of the most recent branch prediction championship increased precision by 3.7% (Dundas, 2016).",,,
19021652,Chinese Whispers: Cooperative Paraphrase Acquisition,"We present a framework for the acquisition of sentential paraphrases based on crowdsourcing. The proposed method maximizes the lexical divergence between an original sentence s and its valid paraphrases by running a sequence of paraphrasing jobs carried out by a crowd of non-expert workers. Instead of collecting direct paraphrases of s, at each step of the sequence workers manipulate semantically equivalent reformulations produced in the previous round. We applied this method to paraphrase English sentences extracted from Wikipedia. Our results show that, keeping at each round n the most promising paraphrases (i.e. the more lexically dissimilar from those acquired at round n-1), the monotonic increase of divergence allows to collect good-quality paraphrases in a cost-effective manner.",,,

Existing frameworks for deep learning must be set up to specialized computer systems. Gaining sufficient computing resources therefore entails high costs of deployment and maintenance. In this work, we implement a matrix library and deep learning framework that uses JavaScript. It can run on web browsers operating on ordinary personal computers and smartphones. Using JavaScript, deep learning can be accomplished in widely diverse environments without the necessity for software installation.

The use of attention makes explicit the manner in which information is propagated between different locations in the sentence, which we use to both analyze our model and propose potential improvements. For example, we find that separating positional and content information in the encoder can lead to improved parsing accuracy. Additionally, we evaluate different approaches for lexical representation. Our parser achieves new state-ofthe-art results for single models trained on the Penn Treebank: 93.55 F1 without the use of any external data, and 95.13 F1 when using pre-trained word representations.

The most common automatic metrics, like BLEU and ROUGE, depend on exact word matching, an inflexible approach for measuring semantic similarity. We introduce methods based on sentence mover's similarity; our automatic metrics evaluate text in a continuous space using word and sentence embeddings. We find that sentence-based metrics correlate with human judgments significantly better than ROUGE, both on machine-generated summaries (average length of 3.4 sentences) and human-authored essays (average length of 7.5). We also show that sentence mover's similarity can be used as a reward when learning a generation model via reinforcement learning; we present both automatic and human evaluations of summaries learned in this way, finding that our approach outperforms ROUGE.1 For readability, we scale ROUGE scores by a factor of 100 and sentence mover's metrics by a factor of 1000.ReferencesMohammed Alshahrani, Spyridon Samothrakis, and Maria Fasli. 2017.

195750622,Selection Via Proxy: Efficient Data Selection For Deep Learning *,"Data selection methods such as active learning and core-set selection are useful tools for machine learning on large datasets, but they can be prohibitively expensive to apply in deep learning. Unlike in other areas of machine learning, the feature representations that these techniques depend on are learned in deep learning rather than given, which takes a substantial amount of training time. In this work, we show that we can significantly improve the computational efficiency of data selection in deep learning by using a much smaller proxy model to perform data selection for tasks that will eventually require a large target model (e.g., selecting data points to label for active learning). In deep learning, we can scale down models by removing hidden layers or reducing their dimension to create proxies that are an order of magnitude faster. Although these small proxy models have significantly higher error, we find that they empirically provide useful rankings for data selection that have a high correlation with those of larger models. We evaluate this ""selection via proxy"" (SVP) approach on several data selection tasks. For active learning, applying SVP to Sener and Savarese [2018]'s recent method for active learning in deep learning gives a 4× improvement in execution time while yielding the same model accuracy. For core-set selection, we show that a proxy model that trains 10× faster than a target ResNet164 model on CIFAR10 can be used to remove 50% of the training data without compromising the accuracy of the target model, making end-to-end training time improvements via core-set selection possible. * updated work from Coleman et al.

To mitigate this issue, we propose to integrate a language understanding module for data refinement with selftraining iterations to effectively induce strong equivalence between the input data and the paired text. Experiments on the E2E challenge dataset show that our proposed framework can reduce more than 50% relative unaligned noise from the original data-text pairs.

196189186,Key Fact as Pivot: A Two-Stage Model for Low Resource Table-to-Text Generation,"Table-to-text generation aims to translate the structured data into the unstructured text. Most existing methods adopt the encoder-decoder framework to learn the transformation, which requires large-scale training samples. However, the lack of large parallel data is a major practical problem for many domains. In this work, we consider the scenario of low resource table-to-text generation, where only limited parallel data is available. We propose a novel model to separate the generation into two stages: key fact prediction and surface realization. It first predicts the key facts from the tables, and then generates the text with the key facts. The training of key fact prediction needs much fewer annotated data, while surface realization can be trained with pseudo parallel corpus. We evaluate our model on a biography generation dataset. Our model can achieve 27.34 BLEU score with only 1, 000 parallel data, while the baseline model only obtain the performance of 9.71 BLEU score. 1",,,

To take advantage of these properties, we integrate multilingual, syllable-level, and fixed-order translation techniques into a general NMT model. Our experimental results demonstrate that this model can outperform a baseline dialect translation model. In addition, we show that visualizing the dialect embeddings learned by the model can facilitate geographical and typological analyses of dialects.",,,

199551982,NEURAL TEXT DEGENERATION WITH UNLIKELIHOOD TRAINING,"Neural text generation is a key tool in natural language applications, but it is well known there are major problems at its core. In particular, standard likelihood training and decoding leads to dull and repetitive responses(Holtzman et al., 2019). While some post-hoc fixes have been proposed, in particular top-k and nucleus sampling, they do not address the fact that the token-level probabilities predicted by the model itself are poor. In this paper we show that the likelihood objective itself is at fault, resulting in a model that assigns too much probability to sequences that contain repeats and frequent words unlike the human training distribution. We propose a new objective, unlikelihood training, which forces unlikely generations to be assigned lower probability by the model. We show that both token and sequence level unlikelihood training give less repetitive, less dull text while maintaining perplexity, giving far superior generations using standard greedy or beam search. Our approach provides a strong alternative to traditional training. * Equal contribution; the ordering was decided by a coin flip.",,,
20038688,META-LEARNING AND UNIVERSALITY: DEEP REPRESENTATIONS AND GRADIENT DESCENT CAN APPROXIMATE ANY LEARNING ALGORITHM,"Learning to learn is a powerful paradigm for enabling models to learn from data more effectively and efficiently. A popular approach to meta-learning is to train a recurrent model to read in a training dataset as input and output the parameters of a learned model, or output predictions for new test inputs. Alternatively, a more recent approach to meta-learning aims to acquire deep representations that can be effectively fine-tuned, via standard gradient descent, to new tasks. In this paper, we consider the meta-learning problem from the perspective of universality, formalizing the notion of learning algorithm approximation and comparing the expressive power of the aforementioned recurrent models to the more recent approaches that embed gradient descent into the meta-learner. In particular, we seek to answer the following question: does deep representation combined with standard gradient descent have sufficient capacity to approximate any learning algorithm? We find that this is indeed true, and further find, in our experiments, that gradient-based meta-learning consistently leads to learning strategies that generalize more widely compared to those represented by recurrent models. .

This makes decoding decisions based on partial source prefixes even though the full source is available. We pursue an alternative approach based on standard sequence to sequence models which utilize the entire source. These models perform remarkably well as channel models, even though they have neither been trained on, nor designed to factor over incomplete target sentences. Experiments with neural language models trained on billions of words show that noisy channel models can outperform a direct model by up to 3.2 BLEU on WMT'17 German-English translation. We evaluate on four language-pairs and our channel models consistently outperform strong alternatives such right-to-left reranking models and ensembles of direct models. 1",,,
201646309,Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks,"BERT(Devlin et al., 2018)and RoBERTa (Liu  et al., 2019)  has set a new state-of-the-art performance on sentence-pair regression tasks like semantic textual similarity (STS). However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations (~65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering.In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT.We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods. 1",,,

Here, we report the results of initial efforts towards exploiting visual information in the form of images to help spatial language understanding. We discuss the way of designing new models in the framework of declarative learning-based programming (DeLBP). The DeLBP framework facilitates combining modalities and representing various data in a unified graph. The learning and inference models exploit the structure of the unified graph as well as the global first order domain constraints beyond the data to predict the semantics which forms a structured meaning representation of the spatial context. Continuous representations are used to relate the various elements of the graph originating from different modalities. We improved over the state-of-the-art results on SpRL.",,,
202540591,CrossWeigh: Training Named Entity Tagger from Imperfect Annotations,"Everyone makes mistakes. So do human annotators when curating labels for named entity recognition (NER). Such label mistakes might hurt model training and interfere model comparison. In this study, we dive deep into one of the widely-adopted NER benchmark datasets, CoNLL03 NER. We are able to identify label mistakes in about 5.38% test sentences, which is a significant ratio considering that the state-of-the-art test F 1 score is already around 93%. Therefore, we manually correct these label mistakes and form a cleaner test set. Our re-evaluation of popular models on this corrected test set leads to more accurate assessments, compared to those on the original test set. More importantly, we propose a simple yet effective framework, CrossWeigh, to handle label mistakes during NER model training. Specifically, it partitions the training data into several folds and train independent NER models to identify potential mistakes in each fold. Then it adjusts the weights of training data accordingly to train the final NER model. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements of plugging various NER models into our proposed framework on three datasets.

202565600,Identifying and Explaining Discriminative Attributes,"Identifying what is at the center of the meaning of a word and what discriminates it from other words is a fundamental natural language inference task. This paper describes an explicit word vector representation model (WVM) to support the identification of discriminative attributes. A core contribution of the paper is a quantitative and qualitative comparative analysis of different types of data sources and Knowledge Bases in the construction of explainable and explicit WVMs: (i) knowledge graphs built from dictionary definitions, (ii) entity-attribute-relationships graphs derived from images and (iii) commonsense knowledge graphs. Using a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that these data sources have complementary semantic aspects, supporting the creation of explicit semantic vector spaces. The explicit vector spaces are evaluated using the task of discriminative attribute identification, showing comparable performance to the state-ofthe-art systems in the task (F1-score = 0.69), while delivering full model transparency and explainability.",,,

By studying the connection between words and events, it is possible to identify which events change our vocabulary and in what way. In this work, we tackle the task of creating timelines-records of historical 'turning points', represented by either words or events, to understand the dynamics of a target word. Our approach identifies these points by leveraging both static and time-varying word embeddings to measure the influence of words and events. In addition to quantifying changes, we show how our technique can help isolate semantic changes. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that we are able to capture this semantic change and event influence.",,,
202719327,TinyBERT: Distilling BERT for Natural Language Understanding,"Language model pre-training, such as BERT, has significantly improved the performances of many natural language processing tasks. However, pre-trained language models are usually computationally expensive, so it is difficult to efficiently execute them on resourcerestricted devices. To accelerate inference and reduce model size while maintaining accuracy, we first propose a novel Transformer distillation method that is specially designed for knowledge distillation (KD) of the Transformer-based models. By leveraging this new KD method, the plenty of knowledge encoded in a large ""teacher"" BERT can be effectively transferred to a small ""student"" Tiny-BERT. Then, we introduce a new two-stage learning framework for TinyBERT, which performs Transformer distillation at both the pretraining and task-specific learning stages. This framework ensures that TinyBERT can capture the general-domain as well as the task-specific knowledge in BERT.TinyBERT 4 1 with 4 layers is empirically effective and achieves more than 96.8% the performance of its teacher BERT BASE on GLUE benchmark, while being 7.5x smaller and 9.4x faster on inference. TinyBERT 4 is also significantly better than 4-layer state-of-the-art baselines on BERT distillation, with only ∼28% parameters and ∼31% inference time of them. Moreover, TinyBERT 6 with 6 layers performs on-par with its teacher BERT BASE . * Authors contribute equally. † This work is done when Xiaoqi Jiao is an intern at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. ‡ Corresponding authors. 1  The code and models are publicly available at https: //github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/ master/TinyBERT",,,
202888986,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 ALBERT: A LITE BERT FOR SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING OF LANGUAGE REPRESENTATIONS,"Increasing model size when pretraining natural language representations often results in improved performance on downstream tasks. However, at some point further model increases become harder due to GPU/TPU memory limitations and longer training times. To address these problems, we present two parameterreduction techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). Comprehensive empirical evidence shows that our proposed methods lead to models that scale much better compared to the original BERT. We also use a self-supervised loss that focuses on modeling inter-sentence coherence, and show it consistently helps downstream tasks with multi-sentence inputs. As a result, our best model establishes new state-of-the-art results on the GLUE, RACE, and SQuAD benchmarks while having fewer parameters compared to BERT-large. The code and the pretrained models are available at https://github.com/google-research/ALBERT.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 These solutions address the memory limitation problem, but not the communication overhead. In this paper, we address all of the aforementioned problems, by designing A Lite BERT (ALBERT) architecture that has significantly fewer parameters than a traditional BERT architecture.ALBERT incorporates two parameter reduction techniques that lift the major obstacles in scaling pre-trained models. The first one is a factorized embedding parameterization. By decomposing the large vocabulary embedding matrix into two small matrices, we separate the size of the hidden layers from the size of vocabulary embedding. This separation makes it easier to grow the hidden size without significantly increasing the parameter size of the vocabulary embeddings. The second technique is cross-layer parameter sharing. This technique prevents the parameter from growing with the depth of the network. Both techniques significantly reduce the number of parameters for BERT without seriously hurting performance, thus improving parameter-efficiency. An ALBERT configuration similar to BERT-large has 18x fewer parameters and can be trained about 1.7x faster. The parameter reduction techniques also act as a form of regularization that stabilizes the training and helps with generalization.To further improve the performance of ALBERT, we also introduce a self-supervised loss for sentence-order prediction (SOP). SOP primary focuses on inter-sentence coherence and is designed to address the ineffectiveness  of the next sentence prediction (NSP) loss proposed in the original BERT.As a result of these design decisions, we are able to scale up to much larger ALBERT configurations that still have fewer parameters than BERT-large but achieve significantly better performance. We establish new state-of-the-art results on the well-known GLUE, SQuAD, and RACE benchmarks for natural language understanding. Specifically, we push the RACE accuracy to 89.4%, the GLUE benchmark to 89.4, and the F1 score of SQuAD 2.0 to 92.2.",,,
203641746,Beyond Linearization: On Quadratic and Higher-Order Approximation of Wide Neural Networks,"Recent theoretical work has established connections between over-parametrized neural networks and linearized models governed by the Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs). NTK theory leads to concrete convergence and generalization results, yet the empirical performance of neural networks are observed to exceed their linearized models, suggesting insufficiency of this theory.Towards closing this gap, we investigate the training of over-parametrized neural networks that are beyond the NTK regime yet still governed by the Taylor expansion of the network. We bring forward the idea of randomizing the neural networks, which allows them to escape their NTK and couple with quadratic models. We show that the optimization landscape of randomized two-layer networks are nice and amenable to escaping-saddle algorithms. We prove concrete generalization and expressivity results on these randomized networks, which leads to sample complexity bounds (of learning certain simple functions) that match the NTK and can in addition be better by a dimension factor when mild distributional assumptions are present. We demonstrate that our randomization technique can be generalized systematically beyond the quadratic case, by using it to find networks that are coupled with higher-order terms in their Taylor series. * Salesforce Research. yu.bai@salesforce.com † Princeton University. jasonlee@princeton.edu design. arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.00501, 2017. .

203836948,INDUCTIVE MATRIX COMPLETION BASED ON GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS,"We propose an inductive matrix completion model without using side information. By factorizing the (rating) matrix into the product of low-dimensional latent embeddings of rows (users) and columns (items), a majority of existing matrix completion methods are transductive, since the learned embeddings cannot generalize to unseen rows/columns or to new matrices. To make matrix completion inductive, most previous works use content (side information), such as user's age or movie's genre, to make predictions. However, high-quality content is not always available, and can be hard to extract. Under the extreme setting where not any side information is available other than the matrix to complete, can we still learn an inductive matrix completion model? In this paper, we propose an Inductive Graph-based Matrix Completion (IGMC) model to address this problem. IGMC trains a graph neural network (GNN) based purely on 1-hop subgraphs around (user, item) pairs generated from the rating matrix and maps these subgraphs to their corresponding ratings. It achieves highly competitive performance with state-of-the-art transductive baselines. In addition, IGMC is inductive -it can generalize to users/items unseen during the training (given that their interactions exist), and can even transfer to new tasks. Our transfer learning experiments show that a model trained out of the MovieLens dataset can be directly used to predict Douban movie ratings with surprisingly good performance. Our work demonstrates that: 1) it is possible to train inductive matrix completion models without using side information while achieving similar or better performances than state-of-the-art transductive methods; 2) local graph patterns around a (user, item) pair are effective predictors of the rating this user gives to the item; and 3) Long-range dependencies might not be necessary for modeling recommender systems.",,,
203837062,How Transformer Revitalizes Character-based Neural Machine Translation: An Investigation on Japanese-Vietnamese Translation Systems,"While translating between East Asian languages, many works have discovered clear advantages of using characters as the translation unit. Unfortunately, traditional recurrent neural machine translation systems hinder the practical usage of those character-based systems due to their architectural limitations. They are unfavorable in handling extremely long sequences as well as highly restricted in parallelizing the computations. In this paper, we demonstrate that the new transformer architecture can perform character-based translation better than the recurrent one. We conduct experiments on a low-resource language pair: Japanese-Vietnamese. Our models considerably outperform the state-of-the-art systems which employ word-based recurrent architectures.",,,
203902511,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 IS A GOOD REPRESENTATION SUFFICIENT FOR SAM- PLE EFFICIENT REINFORCEMENT LEARNING?,"Modern deep learning methods provide effective means to learn good representations. However, is a good representation itself sufficient for sample efficient reinforcement learning? This question has largely been studied only with respect to (worst-case) approximation error, in the more classical approximate dynamic programming literature. With regards to the statistical viewpoint, this question is largely unexplored, and the extant body of literature mainly focuses on conditions which permit sample efficient reinforcement learning with little understanding of what are necessary conditions for efficient reinforcement learning. This work shows that, from the statistical viewpoint, the situation is far subtler than suggested by the more traditional approximation viewpoint, where the requirements on the representation that suffice for sample efficient RL are even more stringent. Our main results provide sharp thresholds for reinforcement learning methods, showing that there are hard limitations on what constitutes good function approximation (in terms of the dimensionality of the representation), where we focus on natural representational conditions relevant to value-based, model-based, and policy-based learning. These lower bounds highlight that having a good (valuebased, model-based, or policy-based) representation in and of itself is insufficient for efficient reinforcement learning, unless the quality of this approximation passes certain hard thresholds. Furthermore, our lower bounds also imply exponential separations on the sample complexity between 1) value-based learning with perfect representation and value-based learning with a good-but-not-perfect representation, 2) value-based learning and policy-based learning, 3) policy-based learning and supervised learning and 4) reinforcement learning and imitation learning. bounds for design matrices with applications to combinatorial geometry and locally correctable codes.

The algorithm uses either a Gumbel-Softmax or online k-means clustering to quantize the dense representations. Discretization enables the direct application of algorithms from the NLP community which require discrete inputs.

204575791,THE LOCAL ELASTICITY OF NEURAL NETWORKS,"This paper presents a phenomenon in neural networks that we refer to as local elasticity. Roughly speaking, a classifier is said to be locally elastic if its prediction at a feature vector x is not significantly perturbed, after the classifier is updated via stochastic gradient descent at a (labeled) feature vector x that is dissimilar to x in a certain sense. This phenomenon is shown to persist for neural networks with nonlinear activation functions through extensive simulations on real-life and synthetic datasets, whereas this is not observed in linear classifiers. In addition, we offer a geometric interpretation of local elasticity using the neural tangent kernel(Jacot et al., 2018). Building on top of local elasticity, we obtain pairwise similarity measures between feature vectors, which can be used for clustering in conjunction with K-means. The effectiveness of the clustering algorithm on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets in turn corroborates the hypothesis of local elasticity of neural networks on real-life data. Finally, we discuss some implications of local elasticity to shed light on several intriguing aspects of deep neural networks.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 (a) The torus.

During the training process of the neural networks, we plot the geodesic distance (see more details in Appendix A.1) between two blue points x and x , and their relative prediction changes (see its definition in Equation (2)) in (b), (c), (e), and (f). The correlations of (b), (c), (e), and (f) are −0.97, −0.48, −0.92, and −0.14, respectively.

204744131,Cross-lingual Parsing with Polyglot Training and Multi-treebank Learning: A Faroese Case Study,"Cross-lingual dependency parsing involves transferring syntactic knowledge from one language to another. It is a crucial component for inducing dependency parsers in low-resource scenarios where no training data for a language exists. Using Faroese as the target language, we compare two approaches using annotation projection: first, projecting from multiple monolingual source models; second, projecting from a single polyglot model which is trained on the combination of all source languages. Furthermore, we reproduce multisource projection(Tyers et al., 2018), in which dependency trees of multiple sources are combined. Finally, we apply multi-treebank modelling to the projected treebanks, in addition to or alternatively to polyglot modelling on the source side. We find that polyglot training on the source languages produces an overall trend of better results on the target language but the single best result for the target language is obtained by projecting from monolingual source parsing models and then training multi-treebank POS tagging and parsing models on the target side.",,,
204906218,Under review as a workshop contribution at ICLR 2015 INDUCING SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION FROM TEXT BY JOINTLY PREDICTING AND FACTORIZING RELA-TIONS,"In this work, we propose a new method to integrate two recent lines of work: unsupervised induction of shallow semantics (e.g., semantic roles) and factorization of relations in text and knowledge bases.Our model consists of two components:(1) an encoding component: a semantic role labeling model which predicts roles given a rich set of syntactic and lexical features; (2) a reconstruction component: a tensor factorization model which relies on roles to predict argument fillers.When the components are estimated jointly to minimize errors in argument reconstruction, the induced roles largely correspond to roles defined in annotated resources.Our method performs on par with most accurate role induction methods on English, even though, unlike these previous approaches, we do not incorporate any prior linguistic knowledge about the language.",,,
204907203,THIEVES ON SESAME STREET! MODEL EXTRACTION OF BERT-BASED APIS,"We study the problem of model extraction in natural language processing, in which an adversary with only query access to a victim model attempts to reconstruct a local copy of that model. Assuming that both the adversary and victim model fine-tune a large pretrained language model such as BERT (Devlin et al.,  2019), we show that the adversary does not need any real training data to successfully mount the attack. In fact, the attacker need not even use grammatical or semantically meaningful queries: we show that random sequences of words coupled with task-specific heuristics form effective queries for model extraction on a diverse set of NLP tasks including natural language inference and question answering. Our work thus highlights an exploit only made feasible by the shift towards transfer learning methods within the NLP community: for a query budget of a few hundred dollars, an attacker can extract a model that performs only slightly worse than the victim model. Finally, we study two defense strategies against model extraction-membership classification and API watermarking-which while successful against naive adversaries, are ineffective against more sophisticated ones.",,,
204960716,"BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension","We present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models. BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and other recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa on GLUE and SQuAD, and achieves new stateof-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 3.5 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to understand their effect on end-task performance. 1",,,
204976362,Evaluating the Factual Consistency of Abstractive Text Summarization,"The most common metrics for assessing summarization algorithms do not account for whether summaries are factually consistent with source documents. We propose a weakly-supervised, model-based approach for verifying factual consistency and identifying conflicts between source documents and generated summaries. Training data is generated by applying a series of rule-based transformations to the sentences of source documents. The factual consistency model is then trained jointly for three tasks: 1) predict whether each summary sentence is factually consistent or not, 2) in either case, extract a span in the source document to support this consistency prediction, 3) for each summary sentence that is deemed inconsistent, extract the inconsistent span from it. Transferring this model to summaries generated by several neural models reveals that this highly scalable approach outperforms previous models, including those trained with strong supervision using datasets from related domains, such as natural language inference and fact checking. Additionally, human evaluation shows that the auxiliary span extraction tasks provide useful assistance in the process of verifying factual consistency. We also release a manually annotated dataset for factual consistency verification, code for training data generation, and trained model weights at https://github.com/salesforce/factCC.",,,
207556454,Enriching Word Vectors with Subword Information,"Continuous word representations, trained on large unlabeled corpora are useful for many natural language processing tasks. Many popular models to learn such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for morphologically rich languages with large vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skip-gram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character n-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character n-gram, words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpus quickly. We evaluate the obtained word representations on five different languages, on word similarity and analogy tasks.",,,
207847275,Preprint. Under review UNDERSTANDING KNOWLEDGE DISTILLATION IN NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE MACHINE TRANSLATION,"Non-autoregressive machine translation (NAT) systems predict a sequence of output tokens in parallel, achieving substantial improvements in generation speed compared to autoregressive models. Existing NAT models usually rely on the technique of knowledge distillation, which creates the training data from a pretrained autoregressive model for better performance. Knowledge distillation is empirically useful, leading to large gains in accuracy for NAT models, but the reason for this success has, as of yet, been unclear. In this paper, we first design systematic experiments to investigate why knowledge distillation is crucial to NAT training. We find that knowledge distillation can reduce the complexity of data sets and help NAT to model the variations in the output data. Furthermore, a strong correlation is observed between the capacity of an NAT model and the optimal complexity of the distilled data for the best translation quality. Based on these findings, we further propose several approaches that can alter the complexity of data sets to improve the performance of NAT models. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance for the NAT-based models, and close the gap with the autoregressive baseline on WMT14 En-De benchmark. 1Preprint. Under review• What is the relationship between the NAT model (student) and the AT model (teacher)? Are different varieties of distilled data better for different NAT models?• Due to distillation, the performance of NAT models is largely bounded by the choice of AT teacher. Is there a way to further close the performance gap with standard AT models?In this paper, we aim to answer the three questions above, improving understanding of knowledge distillation through empirical analysis over a variety of AT and NAT models. Specifically, our contributions are as follows:• We first visualize explicitly on a synthetic dataset how modes are reduced by distillation ( §3.1). Inspired by the synthetic experiments, we further propose metrics for measuring complexity and faithfulness for a given training set. Specifically, our metrics are the conditional entropy and KL-divergence of word translation based on an external alignment tool, and we show these are correlated with NAT model performance ( §3.2).• We conduct a systematic analysis ( §4) over four AT teacher models and six NAT student models with various architectures on the standard WMT14 English-German translation benchmark. These experiments find a strong correlation between the capacity of an NAT model and the optimal dataset complexity for the best translation quality.",,,

207852415,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SELF-ATTENTION AND CONVOLUTIONAL LAYERS,"Recent trends of incorporating attention mechanisms in vision have led researchers to reconsider the supremacy of convolutional layers as a primary building block. Beyond helping CNNs to handle long-range dependencies,Ramachandran et al. (2019)showed that attention can completely replace convolution and achieve state-of-the-art performance on vision tasks. This raises the question: do learned attention layers operate similarly to convolutional layers? This work provides evidence that attention layers can perform convolution and, indeed, they often learn to do so in practice. Specifically, we prove that a multi-head self-attention layer with sufficient number of heads is at least as expressive as any convolutional layer. Our numerical experiments then show that self-attention layers attend to pixel-grid patterns similarly to CNN layers, corroborating our analysis. Our code is publicly available 1 .Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020Contributions. In this work, we put forth theoretical and empirical evidence that self-attention layers can (and do) learn to behave similar to convolutional layers: I. From a theoretical perspective, we provide a constructive proof showing that self-attention layers can express any convolutional layers. Specifically, we show that a single multi-head self-attention layer using relative positional encoding can be re-parametrized to express any convolutional layer.II. Our experiments show that the first few layers of attention-only architectures (Ramachandran et al., 2019) do learn to attend on grid-like pattern around each query pixel, similar to our theoretical construction.Strikingly, this behavior is confirmed both for our quadratic encoding, but also for relative encoding that is learned. Our results seem to suggest that localized convolution is the right inductive bias for the first few layers of an image classifying network. We provide an interactive website 2 to explore how self-attention exploits localized position-based attention in lower layers and contentbased attention in deeper layers. For reproducibility purposes, our code is publicly available.",,,
207880568,Unsupervised Cross-lingual Representation Learning at Scale,"This paper shows that pretraining multilingual language models at scale leads to significant performance gains for a wide range of crosslingual transfer tasks. We train a Transformerbased masked language model on one hundred languages, using more than two terabytes of filtered CommonCrawl data. Our model, dubbed XLM-R, significantly outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on a variety of cross-lingual benchmarks, including +14.6% average accuracy on XNLI, +13% average F1 score on MLQA, and +2.4% F1 score on NER. XLM-R performs particularly well on low-resource languages, improving 15.7% in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 11.4% for Urdu over previous XLM models. We also present a detailed empirical analysis of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource languages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing perlanguage performance; XLM-R is very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks. We will make our code, data and models publicly available. 1",,,
207968164,Towards Actual (Not Operational) Textual Style Transfer Auto-Evaluation,"There are advances on developing methods that do not require parallel corpora, but issues remain with automatic evaluation metrics. Current works(Pang and Gimpel, 2018;Mir et al., 2019)  agree on the following three evaluation aspects. (1) Style accuracy of transferred sentences (measured by a pretrained classifier).(2) Semantic similarity between the original and transferred sentences. (3) Naturalness or fluency: researchers use perplexity of transferred sentences, using the language model pretrained on the original corpora.Problem 1: Style Transfer Tasks. If we think about the practical use cases of style transfer (writing assistance, dialogue, author obfuscation or anonymity, adjusting reading difficulty in education, artistic creations such as works involving literature), we would find that the two would-becollected non-parallel corpora have different vocabularies, and it is hard to differentiate stylerelated words from content-related words. For example, when transferring Dickens' to modern style literature(Pang and Gimpel, 2018), the former may contain ""English farm"", ""horses""; the latter may contain ""vampire"", ""pop music."" But these words should stay the same, as they are content-related but not style-related. On the other hand, Dickens' literature may contain ""devil-maycare"" and ""flummox"", but these words are stylerelated and should be changed. Recent works, however, mostly deal with the operational style where corpus-specific content words are changed. The operational style transfer models work well on Yelp sentiment transfer which almost all researches focus on, but it does not inspire systems in practical use cases.Problem 2: Metrics. Consider: Oliver deemed the gathering in York a great success. The ex- § Abstract written while the author was a student at the University of Chicago. pected transfer from Dickens to modern literature style should be similar to ""Oliver thought the gathering was successful"" (actual style transfer). However, the most likely transfer (if we use most existing models) will be ""Karl enjoyed the party in LA"" (operational style transfer). In evaluating semantic similarity, Mir et al.(2019)masked style keywords determined by a classifier. In this case, all corpus-specific content words (as well as style words) will be masked, and evaluation will fail. However, we can create the list of style keywords with outside knowledge. We can also consider keeping the words as they are without masking. Similar problems exist for the other two metrics.Problem 3: Trade-off and Aggregation. Aggregation of metrics is especially helpful as there are tradeoffs(Pang and Gimpel, 2018;Mir et al.,  2019), and we need to tune and select models systematically. Use A, B, C to represent the three metrics. For sentence s, define G t 1 ,t 2 ,t 3 ,t 4 (s) =where t i 's are the parameters to be learned. 1 (Small and large C's are both bad.) The current research strives for a universal metric. We can randomly sample a few hundred pairs of transferred sentences from a range of style transfer outputs (from different models-good ones and bad ones) from a range of style transfer tasks, and ask annotators which of the two transferred sentences (from the same original sentence) is better. We can then train the parameters based on pairwise comparison. To make G more convincing, we may design more complicated functions G = f (A, B, C). If we do not need a universal evaluator, then we can repeat the above procedure by only sampling pairs of transferred sentences from the dataset of interest, which is more accurate for the particular task.",,,
208100714,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 ON IDENTIFIABILITY IN TRANSFORMERS,"In this paper we delve deep in the Transformer architecture by investigating two of its core components: self-attention and contextual embeddings. In particular, we study the identifiability of attention weights and token embeddings, and the aggregation of context into hidden tokens. We show that, for sequences longer than the attention head dimension, attention weights are not identifiable. We propose effective attention as a complementary tool for improving explanatory interpretations based on attention. Furthermore, we show that input tokens retain to a large degree their identity across the model. We also find evidence suggesting that identity information is mainly encoded in the angle of the embeddings and gradually decreases with depth. Finally, we demonstrate strong mixing of input information in the generation of contextual embeddings by means of a novel quantification method based on gradient attribution. Overall, we show that self-attention distributions are not directly interpretable and present tools to better understand and further investigate Transformer models. * Equal contribution with authors in alphabetical order.

208202182,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 LEARNING HIERARCHICAL DISCRETE LINGUISTIC UNITS FROM VISUALLY-GROUNDED SPEECH,"In this paper, we present a method for learning discrete linguistic units by incorporating vector quantization layers into neural models of visually grounded speech. We show that our method is capable of capturing both word-level and sub-word units, depending on how it is configured. What differentiates this paper from prior work on speech unit learning is the choice of training objective. Rather than using a reconstruction-based loss, we use a discriminative, multimodal grounding objective which forces the learned units to be useful for semantic image retrieval. We evaluate the sub-word units on the ZeroSpeech 2019 challenge, achieving a 27.3% reduction in ABX error rate over the top-performing submission, while keeping the bitrate approximately the same. We also present experiments demonstrating the noise robustness of these units. Finally, we show that a model with multiple quantizers can simultaneously learn phone-like detectors at a lower layer and word-like detectors at a higher layer. We show that these detectors are highly accurate, discovering 279 words with an F1 score of greater than 0.5.",,,

In the latter the variational formulation of the Poisson problem is used in order to obtain an objective function a regularised Dirichlet energy that was used for the optimisation of some neural networks. Although this approach showed good visual performance and promising empirical results it is lacking any convergence guarantees. In this notes we use the notion of Γ-convergence to show that ReLU networks of growing architecture that are trained with respect to suitably regularised Dirichlet energies converge to the true solution of the Poisson problem. We discuss how this approach generalises to arbitrary variational problems under certain universality assumptions of neural networks and see that this covers some nonlinear stationary PDEs like the p-Laplace.",,,
209478454,THE VARIATIONAL BANDWIDTH BOTTLENECK: STOCHASTIC EVALUATION ON AN INFORMATION BUDGET,"In many applications, it is desirable to extract only the relevant information from complex input data, which involves making a decision about which input features are relevant. The information bottleneck method formalizes this as an informationtheoretic optimization problem by maintaining an optimal tradeoff between compression (throwing away irrelevant input information), and predicting the target. In many problem settings, including the reinforcement learning problems we consider in this work, we might prefer to compress only part of the input. This is typically the case when we have a standard conditioning input, such as a state observation, and a ""privileged"" input, which might correspond to the goal of a task, the output of a costly planning algorithm, or communication with another agent. In such cases, we might prefer to compress the privileged input, either to achieve better generalization (e.g., with respect to goals) or to minimize access to costly information (e.g., in the case of communication). Practical implementations of the information bottleneck based on variational inference require access to the privileged input in order to compute the bottleneck variable, so although they perform compression, this compression operation itself needs unrestricted, lossless access. In this work, we propose the variational bandwidth bottleneck, which decides for each example on the estimated value of the privileged information before seeing it, i.e., only based on the standard input, and then accordingly chooses stochastically, whether to access the privileged input or not. We formulate a tractable approximation to this framework and demonstrate in a series of reinforcement learning experiments that it can improve generalization and reduce access to computationally costly information.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 address this issue, we propose to divide our input into two categories: standard input and privileged input, and then we aim to design a bottleneck that does not need to access the privileged input before deciding how much information about the input is necessary. The intuition behind not accessing the privileged input is twofold: (a) we might want to avoid accessing the privileged input because we want to generalize with respect to it (and therefore compress it) (b) we actually would prefer not to access it (as this input could be costly to obtain).The objective is to minimize the conditional mutual information between the bottleneck layer and the privileged input, given the standard input. This problem statement is more narrow than the standard information bottleneck, but encompasses many practical use cases. For example, in reinforcement learning, which is the primary subject of our experiments, the agent can be augmented with some privileged information in the form of a model based planner, or information which is the result of communication with another agent. This ""additional"" information can be seen as a privileged input because it requires the agent to do something extra to obtain it.Our work provides the following contributions. First, we propose a variational bandwidth bottleneck (VBB) that does not look at the privileged input before deciding whether to use it or not. At a high level, the network is trained first to examine the standard input, and then stochastically decide whether to access the privileged input or not. Second, we illustrate several applications of this approach to reinforcement learning, in order to construct agents that can stochastically determine when to evaluate costly model based computations, when to communicate with another agent, and when to access the memory. We experimentally show that the proposed model produces better generalization, as it learns when to use (or not use) the privileged input. For example, in the case of maze navigation, the agent learns to access information about the goal location only near natural bottlenecks, such as doorways.",,,

It is however without further investigation. We provide the exact formula for the optimal value function for both the discrete and the continuous cases. Though simple as it might seem, the value function is pathological: fractal, self-similar, derivative taking either zero or infinity, not smooth on any interval, and not written as elementary functions. It is in fact one of the generalized Cantor functions, where it holds a complexity that has been uncharted thus far.

209531937,NAS-BENCH-201: EXTENDING THE SCOPE OF RE- PRODUCIBLE NEURAL ARCHITECTURE SEARCH,"Neural architecture search (NAS) has achieved breakthrough success in a great number of applications in the past few years. It could be time to take a step back and analyze the good and bad aspects in the field of NAS. A variety of algorithms search architectures under different search space. These searched architectures are trained using different setups, e.g., hyper-parameters, data augmentation, regularization. This raises a comparability problem when comparing the performance of various NAS algorithms. NAS-Bench-101 has shown success to alleviate this problem. In this work, we propose an extension to NAS-Bench-101: NAS-Bench-201 with a different search space, results on multiple datasets, and more diagnostic information. NAS-Bench-201 has a fixed search space and provides a unified benchmark for almost any up-to-date NAS algorithms. The design of our search space is inspired from the one used in the most popular cell-based searching algorithms, where a cell is represented as a directed acyclic graph. Each edge here is associated with an operation selected from a predefined operation set. For it to be applicable for all NAS algorithms, the search space defined in NAS-Bench-201 includes all possible architectures generated by 4 nodes and 5 associated operation options, which results in 15,625 neural cell candidates in total. The training log using the same setup and the performance for each architecture candidate are provided for three datasets. This allows researchers to avoid unnecessary repetitive training for selected architecture and focus solely on the search algorithm itself. The training time saved for every architecture also largely improves the efficiency of most NAS algorithms and brings a more computational cost friendly NAS community for a broader range of researchers. We provide additional diagnostic information such as fine-grained loss and accuracy, which can give inspirations to new designs of NAS algorithms. In further support of the proposed NAS-Bench-201, we have analyzed it from many aspects and benchmarked 10 recent NAS algorithms, which verify its applicability.Recently, a variety of NAS algorithms have been increasingly proposed.

209532006,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 META REINFORCEMENT LEARNING WITH AUTONOMOUS INFERENCE OF SUBTASK DEPENDENCIES,"We propose and address a novel few-shot RL problem, where a task is characterized by a subtask graph which describes a set of subtasks and their dependencies that are unknown to the agent. The agent needs to quickly adapt to the task over few episodes during adaptation phase to maximize the return in the test phase. Instead of directly learning a meta-policy, we develop a Meta-learner with Subtask Graph Inference (MSGI), which infers the latent parameter of the task by interacting with the environment and maximizes the return given the latent parameter. To facilitate learning, we adopt an intrinsic reward inspired by upper confidence bound (UCB) that encourages efficient exploration. Our experiment results on two grid-world domains and StarCraft II environments show that the proposed method is able to accurately infer the latent task parameter, and to adapt more efficiently than existing meta RL and hierarchical RL methods 1 .",,,
209862859,MUTUAL MEAN-TEACHING: PSEUDO LABEL REFINERY FOR UNSUPERVISED DO- MAIN ADAPTATION ON PERSON RE-IDENTIFICATION,"Person re-identification (re-ID) aims at identifying the same persons' images across different cameras. However, domain diversities between different datasets pose an evident challenge for adapting the re-ID model trained on one dataset to another one. State-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods for person re-ID transferred the learned knowledge from the source domain by optimizing with pseudo labels created by clustering algorithms on the target domain. Although they achieved state-of-the-art performances, the inevitable label noise caused by the clustering procedure was ignored. Such noisy pseudo labels substantially hinders the model's capability on further improving feature representations on the target domain. In order to mitigate the effects of noisy pseudo labels, we propose to softly refine the pseudo labels in the target domain by proposing an unsupervised framework, Mutual Mean-Teaching (MMT), to learn better features from the target domain via off-line refined hard pseudo labels and on-line refined soft pseudo labels in an alternative training manner. In addition, the common practice is to adopt both the classification loss and the triplet loss jointly for achieving optimal performances in person re-ID models. However, conventional triplet loss cannot work with softly refined labels. To solve this problem, a novel soft softmax-triplet loss is proposed to support learning with soft pseudo triplet labels for achieving the optimal domain adaptation performance. The proposed MMT framework achieves considerable improvements of 14.4%, 18.2%, 13.4% and 16.4% mAP on Market-to-Duke, Duke-to-Market, Market-to-MSMT and Duke-to-MSMT unsupervised domain adaptation tasks. 1",,,
210838924,Exploiting Cloze Questions for Few Shot Text Classification and Natural Language Inference,"Some NLP tasks can be solved in a fully unsupervised fashion by providing a pretrained language model with ""task descriptions"" in natural language (e.g., Radford et al., 2019). While this approach underperforms its supervised counterpart, we show in this work that the two ideas can be combined: We introduce Pattern-Exploiting Training (PET), a semi-supervised training procedure that reformulates input examples as cloze-style phrases to help language models understand a given task. These phrases are then used to assign soft labels to a large set of unlabeled examples. Finally, standard supervised training is performed on the resulting training set. For several tasks and languages, PET outperforms supervised training and strong semi-supervised approaches in lowresource settings by a large margin. 1",,,

They are ideal environments for studying how to extend reinforcement learning agents to meet the challenges of natural language understanding, partial observability, and action generation in combinatorially-large text-based action spaces. We present KG-A2C 1 , an agent that builds a dynamic knowledge graph while exploring and generates actions using a template-based action space. We contend that the dual uses of the knowledge graph to reason about game state and to constrain natural language generation are the keys to scalable exploration of combinatorially large natural language actions. Results across a wide variety of IF games show that KG-A2C outperforms current IF agents despite the exponential increase in action space size.",,,

In this work, we introduce a Question Decomposition Meaning Representation (QDMR) for questions. QDMR constitutes the ordered list of steps, expressed through natural language, that are necessary for answering a question. We develop a crowdsourcing pipeline, showing that quality QDMRs can be annotated at scale, and release the BREAK dataset, containing over 83K pairs of questions and their QDMRs. We demonstrate the utility of QDMR by showing that (a) it can be used to improve open-domain question answering on the HOTPOTQA dataset, (b) it can be deterministically converted to a pseudo-SQL formal language, which can alleviate annotation in semantic parsing applications. Last, we use BREAK to train a sequence-to-sequence model with copying that parses questions into QDMR structures, and show that it substantially outperforms several natural baselines.",,,

We introduce Torch-Struct, a library for structured prediction designed to take advantage of and integrate with vectorized, auto-differentiation based frameworks. Torch-Struct includes a broad collection of probabilistic structures accessed through a simple and flexible distribution-based API that connects to any deep learning model. The library utilizes batched, vectorized operations and exploits auto-differentiation to produce readable, fast, and testable code.

However, a central challenge in video prediction is that the future is highly uncertain: a sequence of past observations of events can imply many possible futures. Although a number of recent works have studied probabilistic models that can represent uncertain futures, such models are either extremely expensive computationally as in the case of pixel-level autoregressive models, or do not directly optimize the likelihood of the data. To our knowledge, our work is the first to propose multi-frame video prediction with normalizing flows, which allows for direct optimization of the data likelihood, and produces high-quality stochastic predictions. We describe an approach for modeling the latent space dynamics, and demonstrate that flow-based generative models offer a viable and competitive approach to generative modeling of video. * A majority of this work was done as part of the Google AI Residency Program.",,,
211126562,FREQUENCY-BASED SEARCH-CONTROL IN DYNA,"Model-based reinforcement learning has been empirically demonstrated as a successful strategy to improve sample efficiency. In particular, Dyna is an elegant model-based architecture integrating learning and planning that provides huge flexibility of using a model. One of the most important components in Dyna is called search-control, which refers to the process of generating state or state-action pairs from which we query the model to acquire simulated experiences. Searchcontrol is critical in improving learning efficiency. In this work, we propose a simple and novel search-control strategy by searching high frequency regions of the value function. Our main intuition is built on Shannon sampling theorem from signal processing, which indicates that a high frequency signal requires more samples to reconstruct. We empirically show that a high frequency function is more difficult to approximate. This suggests a search-control strategy: we should use states from high frequency regions of the value function to query the model to acquire more samples. We develop a simple strategy to locally measure the frequency of a function by gradient and hessian norms, and provide theoretical justification for this approach. We then apply our strategy to search-control in Dyna, and conduct experiments to show its property and effectiveness on benchmark domains. * Equal contribution.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 model errors too, which causes some performance deterioration(Talvitie, 2014;2017).

211132391,UNDERSTANDING THE LIMITATIONS OF CONDITIONAL GENERATIVE MODELS,"Class-conditional generative models hold promise to overcome the shortcomings of their discriminative counterparts. They are a natural choice to solve discriminative tasks in a robust manner as they jointly optimize for predictive performance and accurate modeling of the input distribution. In this work, we investigate robust classification with likelihood-based generative models from a theoretical and practical perspective to investigate if they can deliver on their promises. Our analysis focuses on a spectrum of robustness properties:(1)Detection of worst-case outliers in the form of adversarial examples; (2) Detection of average-case outliers in the form of ambiguous inputs and (3) Detection of incorrectly labeled in-distribution inputs.Our theoretical result reveals that it is impossible to guarantee detectability of adversarially-perturbed inputs even for near-optimal generative classifiers. Experimentally, we find that while we are able to train robust models for MNIST, robustness completely breaks down on CIFAR10. We relate this failure to various undesirable model properties that can be traced to the maximum likelihood training objective. Despite being a common choice in the literature, our results indicate that likelihood-based conditional generative models may are surprisingly ineffective for robust classification.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 jointly modeling the input and target distribution should make it easy to detect out-of-distribution inputs. These traits lend hope to the belief that good class-conditional generative models can overcome important problems faced by discriminative models.",,,
211132493,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 JELLY BEAN WORLD: A TESTBED FOR NEVER-ENDING LEARNING,"Machine learning has shown growing success in recent years. However, current machine learning systems are highly specialized, trained for particular problems or domains, and typically on a single narrow dataset. Human learning, on the other hand, is highly general and adaptable. Never-ending learning is a machine learning paradigm that aims to bridge this gap, with the goal of encouraging researchers to design machine learning systems that can learn to perform a wider variety of inter-related tasks in more complex environments. To date, there is no environment or testbed to facilitate the development and evaluation of never-ending learning systems. To this end, we propose the Jelly Bean World testbed. The Jelly Bean World allows experimentation over two-dimensional grid worlds which are filled with items and in which agents can navigate. This testbed provides environments that are sufficiently complex and where more generally intelligent algorithms ought to perform better than current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approaches. It does so by producing non-stationary environments and facilitating experimentation with multi-task, multi-agent, multi-modal, and curriculum learning settings. We hope that the Jelly Bean World will prompt new interest in the development of never-ending learning, and more broadly general intelligence. * Equal contribution (listed in alphabetical order).",,,
211132734,A CLOSER LOOK AT THE APPROXIMATION CAPABILI- TIES OF NEURAL NETWORKS,"The universal approximation theorem, in one of its most general versions, says that if we consider only continuous activation functions σ, then a standard feedforward neural network with one hidden layer is able to approximate any continuous multivariate function f to any given approximation threshold ε, if and only if σ is non-polynomial. In this paper, we give a direct algebraic proof of the theorem. Furthermore we shall explicitly quantify the number of hidden units required for approximation. Specifically, if X ⊆ R n is compact, then a neural network with n input units, m output units, and a single hidden layer with n+d d hidden units (independent of m and ε), can uniformly approximate any polynomial function f : X → R m whose total degree is at most d for each of its m coordinate functions. In the general case that f is any continuous function, we show there exists some N ∈ O(ε −n ) (independent of m), such that N hidden units would suffice to approximate f . We also show that this uniform approximation property (UAP) still holds even under seemingly strong conditions imposed on the weights. We highlight several consequences: (i) For any δ > 0, the UAP still holds if we restrict all non-bias weights w in the last layer to satisfy |w| < δ. (ii) There exists some λ > 0 (depending only on f and σ), such that the UAP still holds if we restrict all non-bias weights w in the first layer to satisfy |w| > λ. (iii) If the non-bias weights in the first layer are fixed and randomly chosen from a suitable range, then the UAP holds with probability 1.",,,
211204780,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 KEEP DOING WHAT WORKED: BEHAVIOR MODELLING PRIORS FOR OFFLINE REIN- FORCEMENT LEARNING,"Off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms promise to be applicable in settings where only a fixed data-set (batch) of environment interactions is available and no new experience can be acquired. This property makes these algorithms appealing for real world problems such as robot control. In practice, however, standard off-policy algorithms fail in the batch setting for continuous control. In this paper, we propose a simple solution to this problem. It admits the use of data generated by arbitrary behavior policies and uses a learned prior -the advantage-weighted behavior model (ABM) -to bias the RL policy towards actions that have previously been executed and are likely to be successful on the new task. Our method can be seen as an extension of recent work on batch-RL that enables stable learning from conflicting data-sources.

211252650,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 LEARNING TO REPRESENT PROGRAMS WITH PROPERTY SIGNATURES,"We introduce the notion of property signatures, a representation for programs and program specifications meant for consumption by machine learning algorithms. Given a function with input type τ in and output type τ out , a property is a function of type: (τ in , τ out ) → Bool that (informally) describes some simple property of the function under consideration. For instance, if τ in and τ out are both lists of the same type, one property might ask 'is the input list the same length as the output list?'. If we have a list of such properties, we can evaluate them all for our function to get a list of outputs that we will call the property signature. Crucially, we can 'guess' the property signature for a function given only a set of input/output pairs meant to specify that function. We discuss several potential applications of property signatures and show experimentally that they can be used to improve over a baseline synthesizer so that it emits twice as many programs in less than one-tenth of the time.",,,
211259427,"Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 TRIPLE WINS: BOOSTING ACCURACY, ROBUSTNESS AND EFFICIENCY TOGETHER BY ENABLING INPUT- ADAPTIVE INFERENCE","Deep networks were recently suggested to face the odds between accuracy (on clean natural images) and robustness (on adversarially perturbed images)(Tsipras et al., 2019). Such a dilemma is shown to be rooted in the inherently higher sample complexity ) and/or model capacity (Nakkiran, 2019), for learning a high-accuracy and robust classifier. In view of that, give a classification task, growing the model capacity appears to help draw a win-win between accuracy and robustness, yet at the expense of model size and latency, therefore posing challenges for resource-constrained applications. Is it possible to co-design model accuracy, robustness and efficiency to achieve their triple wins? This paper studies multi-exit networks associated with input-adaptive efficient inference, showing their strong promise in achieving a ""sweet point"" in cooptimizing model accuracy, robustness and efficiency. Our proposed solution, dubbed Robust Dynamic Inference Networks (RDI-Nets), allows for each input (either clean or adversarial) to adaptively choose one of the multiple output layers (early branches or the final one) to output its prediction. That multi-loss adaptivity adds new variations and flexibility to adversarial attacks and defenses, on which we present a systematical investigation. We show experimentally that by equipping existing backbones with such robust adaptive inference, the resulting RDI-Nets can achieve better accuracy and robustness, yet with over 30% computational savings, compared to the defended original models.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 and on a given dataset, such trade-off might be effectively alleviated (""win-win""), if supplying more training data and/or replacing a larger-capacity classifier.On a separate note, deep networks also face the pressing challenge to be deployed on resourceconstrained platforms due to the prosperity of smart Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Many IoT applications naturally demand security and trustworthiness, e.g., , biometrics and identity verification, but can only afford limited latency, memory and energy budget. Hereby we extend the question: can we achieve a triple-win, i.e., , an accurate and robust classfier while keeping it efficient?This paper makes an attempt in providing a positive answer to the above question. Rather than proposing a specific design of robust light-weight models, we reduce the average computation loads by input-adaptive routing to achieve triple-win. To this end, we introduce the input-adaptive dynamic inference(Teerapittayanon et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2018a), an emerging efficient inference scheme in contrast to the (non-adaptive) model compression, to the adversarial defense field for the first time. Given any deep network backbone (e.g., , ResNet, MobileNet), we first follow(Teerapittayanon et al., 2017)to augment it with multiple early-branch output layers in addition to the original final output. Each input, regardless of clean or adversarial samples, adaptively chooses which output layer to take for its own prediction. Therefore, a large portion of input inferences can be terminated early when the samples can already be inferred with high confidence.",,,
211532533,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 RETHINKING THE HYPERPARAMETERS FOR FINE-TUNING,"Fine-tuning from pre-trained ImageNet models has become the de-facto standard for various computer vision tasks. Current practices for fine-tuning typically involve selecting an ad-hoc choice of hyperparameters and keeping them fixed to values normally used for training from scratch. This paper re-examines several common practices of setting hyperparameters for fine-tuning. Our findings are based on extensive empirical evaluation for fine-tuning on various transfer learning benchmarks. (1) While prior works have thoroughly investigated learning rate and batch size, momentum for fine-tuning is a relatively unexplored parameter. We find that the value of momentum also affects fine-tuning performance and connect it with previous theoretical findings. (2) Optimal hyperparameters for fine-tuning, in particular, the effective learning rate, are not only dataset dependent but also sensitive to the similarity between the source domain and target domain. This is in contrast to hyperparameters for training from scratch. (3) Reference-based regularization that keeps models close to the initial model does not necessarily apply for ""dissimilar"" datasets. Our findings challenge common practices of finetuning and encourages deep learning practitioners to rethink the hyperparameters for fine-tuning.",,,

211818155,Improving Candidate Generation for Low-resource Cross-lingual Entity Linking,"Cross-lingual entity linking (XEL) is the task of finding referents in a target-language knowledge base (KB) for mentions extracted from source-language texts. The first step of (X)EL is candidate generation, which retrieves a list of plausible candidate entities from the target-language KB for each mention. Approaches based on resources from Wikipedia have proven successful in the realm of relatively high-resource languages, but these do not extend well to low-resource languages with few, if any, Wikipedia pages. Recently, transfer learning methods have been shown to reduce the demand for resources in the lowresource languages by utilizing resources in closely related languages, but the performance still lags far behind their high-resource counterparts. In this paper, we first assess the problems faced by current entity candidate generation methods for low-resource XEL, then propose three improvements that (1) reduce the disconnect between entity mentions and KB entries, and (2) improve the robustness of the model to low-resource scenarios. The methods are simple, but effective: We experiment with our approach on seven XEL datasets and find that they yield an average gain of 16.9% in TOP-30 gold candidate recall, compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Our improved model also yields an average gain of 7.9% in in-KB accuracy of end-to-end XEL. 1",,,
212718077,Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers,"Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n 1.5 d) from O(n 2 d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

213085920,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 STRATEGIES FOR PRE-TRAINING GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS,"Many applications of machine learning require a model to make accurate predictions on test examples that are distributionally different from training ones, while task-specific labels are scarce during training. An effective approach to this challenge is to pre-train a model on related tasks where data is abundant, and then fine-tune it on a downstream task of interest. While pre-training has been effective in many language and vision domains, it remains an open question how to effectively use pre-training on graph datasets. In this paper, we develop a new strategy and self-supervised methods for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The key to the success of our strategy is to pre-train an expressive GNN at the level of individual nodes as well as entire graphs so that the GNN can learn useful local and global representations simultaneously. We systematically study pre-training on multiple graph classification datasets. We find that naïve strategies, which pre-train GNNs at the level of either entire graphs or individual nodes, give limited improvement and can even lead to negative transfer on many downstream tasks. In contrast, our strategy avoids negative transfer and improves generalization significantly across downstream tasks, leading up to 9.4% absolute improvements in ROC-AUC over non-pre-trained models and achieving state-of-the-art performance for molecular property prediction and protein function prediction. * Equal contribution.

Instead, it requires substantial domain expertise to carefully select examples and target labels that are correlated with the downstream task of interest. Otherwise, the transfer of knowledge from related pre-training tasks to a new downstream task can harm generalization, which is known as negative transfer(Rosenstein et al., 2005)and significantly limits the applicability and reliability of pre-trained models.Present work.

For that, we build two large new pre-training datasets, which we share with the community: a chemistry dataset with 2 million graphs and a biology dataset with 395K graphs. We also show that large domain-specific datasets are crucial to investigate pre-training and that existing downstream benchmark datasets are too small to evaluate models in a statistically reliable way.(2) We develop an effective pretraining strategy for GNNs and demonstrate its effectiveness and its ability for out-of-distribution generalization on hard transfer-learning problems.",,,
213179475,TRANSFERABLE PERTURBATIONS OF DEEP FEATURE DISTRIBUTIONS,"Almost all current adversarial attacks of CNN classifiers rely on information derived from the output layer of the network. This work presents a new adversarial attack based on the modeling and exploitation of class-wise and layer-wise deep feature distributions. We achieve state-of-the-art targeted blackbox transfer-based attack results for undefended ImageNet models. Further, we place a priority on explainability and interpretability of the attacking process. Our methodology affords an analysis of how adversarial attacks change the intermediate feature distributions of CNNs, as well as a measure of layer-wise and class-wise feature distributional separability/entanglement. We also conceptualize a transition from task/data-specific to model-specific features within a CNN architecture that directly impacts the transferability of adversarial examples.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 trained on ImageNet-1k(Deng et al., 2009). Adversarial examples are then generated on the whitebox model and transferred to the blackbox model. The novelty of the attack comes from the explicit use of class-wise and layer-wise feature distributions. InFigure 1(top), an auxiliary Neural Network (NN) g l,c learns p(y = c|f l (x)), which is the probability that the layer l features of the whitebox model, extracted from input image x, belong to class c. The attack uses these learned distributions to generate targeted (or untargeted) adversarial examples by maximizing (or minimizing) the probability that the adversarial example is from a particular class's feature distribution(Figure 1(bottom)). We also use these learned distributions to analyze layer-wise and model-wise transfer properties, and to monitor how perturbations of the input change feature space representations. Thus, we gain insights on how feature distributions evolve with layer depth and architecture.",,,

By not assuming the structure of the recommender system, our approach can be used in general settings. In our experiments, we focus on a prominent use of machine learning recommendation: ad-click prediction.

What's more, the same approach to interpret interactions can provide new insights into domains even beyond recommendation, such as text and image classification.",,,
213929104,Generating Dialogue Responses from a Semantic Latent Space,"Existing open-domain dialogue generation models are usually trained to mimic the gold response in the training set using cross-entropy loss on the vocabulary. However, a good response does not need to resemble the gold response, since there are multiple possible responses to a given prompt. In this work, we hypothesize that the current models are unable to integrate information from multiple semantically similar valid responses of a prompt, resulting in the generation of generic and uninformative responses. To address this issue, we propose an alternative to the end-to-end classification on vocabulary. We learn the pair relationship between the prompts and responses as a regression task on a latent space instead. In our novel dialog generation model, the representations of semantically related sentences are close to each other on the latent space. Human evaluation showed that learning the task on a continuous space can generate responses that are both relevant and informative.",,,
213969759,MUTUAL INFORMATION GRADIENT ESTIMATION FOR REPRESENTATION LEARNING,"Mutual Information (MI) plays an important role in representation learning. However, MI is unfortunately intractable in continuous and high-dimensional settings. Recent advances establish tractable and scalable MI estimators to discover useful representation. However, most of the existing methods are not capable of providing an accurate estimation of MI with low-variance when the MI is large. We argue that directly estimating the gradients of MI is more appealing for representation learning than estimating MI in itself. To this end, we propose the Mutual Information Gradient Estimator (MIGE) for representation learning based on the score estimation of implicit distributions. MIGE exhibits a tight and smooth gradient estimation of MI in the high-dimensional and large-MI settings. We expand the applications of MIGE in both unsupervised learning of deep representations based on InfoMax and the Information Bottleneck method.

The sample complexity of existing methods is high and depends on problem dimensionality, unlike the dimensionality-independent rates of first-order methods. The recent success of deep learning suggests that many datasets lie on low-dimensional manifolds that can be represented by deep nonlinear models. We therefore consider derivative-free optimization of a high-dimensional function that lies on a latent low-dimensional manifold. We develop an online learning approach that learns this manifold while performing the optimization. In other words, we jointly learn the manifold and optimize the function. Our analysis suggests that the presented method significantly reduces sample complexity. We empirically evaluate the method on continuous optimization benchmarks and high-dimensional continuous control problems.

215238965,Information-Theoretic Probing for Linguistic Structure,"The success of neural networks on a diverse set of NLP tasks has led researchers to question how much do these networks actually know about natural language. Probes are a natural way of assessing this. When probing, a researcher chooses a linguistic task and trains a supervised model to predict annotation in that linguistic task from the network's learned representations. If the probe does well, the researcher may conclude that the representations encode knowledge related to the task. A commonly held belief is that using simpler models as probes is better; the logic is that such models will identify linguistic structure, but not learn the task itself. We propose an information-theoretic formalization of probing as estimating mutual information that contradicts this received wisdom: one should always select the highest performing probe one can, even if it is more complex, since it will result in a tighter estimate. The empirical portion of our paper focuses on obtaining tight estimates for how much information BERT knows about parts of speech in a set of five typologically diverse languages that are often underrepresented in parsing research, plus English, totaling six languages. We find BERT accounts for only at most 5% more information than traditional, type-based word embeddings.",,,
21529792,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018 LEARNING ROBUST REWARDS WITH ADVERSARIAL INVERSE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING,"Reinforcement learning provides a powerful and general framework for decision making and control, but its application in practice is often hindered by the need for extensive feature and reward engineering. Deep reinforcement learning methods can remove the need for explicit engineering of policy or value features, but still require a manually specified reward function. Inverse reinforcement learning holds the promise of automatic reward acquisition, but has proven exceptionally difficult to apply to large, high-dimensional problems with unknown dynamics. In this work, we propose AIRL, a practical and scalable inverse reinforcement learning algorithm based on an adversarial reward learning formulation. We demonstrate that AIRL is able to recover reward functions that are robust to changes in dynamics, enabling us to learn policies even under significant variation in the environment seen during training. Our experiments show that AIRL greatly outperforms prior methods in these transfer settings.",,,
215548904,Interpretability Analysis for Named Entity Recognition to Understand System Predictions and How They Can Improve under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license Computational Linguistics,"Named entity recognition systems achieve remarkable performance on domains such as English news. It is natural to ask: What are these models actually learning to achieve this? Are they merely memorizing the names themselves? Or are they capable of interpreting the text and inferring the correct entity type from the linguistic context? We examine these questions by contrasting the performance of several variants of architectures for named entity recognition, with some provided only representations of the context as features. We experiment with GloVebased BiLSTM-CRF as well as BERT. We find that context does influence predictions, but the main factor driving high performance is learning the named tokens themselves. Furthermore, we find that BERT is not always better at recognizing predictive contexts compared to a BiLSTM-CRF model. We enlist human annotators to evaluate the feasibility of inferring entity types from context alone and find that humans are also mostly unable to infer entity types for the majority of examples on which the context-only system made errors. However, there is room for improvement: A system should be able to recognize any named entity in a predictive context correctly Submission Volume 47, Number 1 and our experiments indicate that current systems may be improved by such capability. Our human study also revealed that systems and humans do not always learn the same contextual clues, and context-only systems are sometimes correct even when humans fail to recognize the entity type from the context. Finally, we find that one issue contributing to model errors is the use of ""entangled"" representations that encode both contextual and local token information into a single vector, which can obscure clues. Our results suggest that designing models that explicitly operate over representations of local inputs and context, respectively, may in some cases improve performance. In light of these and related findings, we highlight directions for future work.",,,
216144650,Improving Massively Multilingual Neural Machine Translation and Zero-Shot Translation,"Massively multilingual models for neural machine translation (NMT) are theoretically attractive, but often underperform bilingual models and deliver poor zero-shot translations. In this paper, we explore ways to improve them. We argue that multilingual NMT requires stronger modeling capacity to support language pairs with varying typological characteristics, and overcome this bottleneck via language-specific components and deepening NMT architectures. We identify the off-target translation issue (i.e. translating into a wrong target language) as the major source of the inferior zero-shot performance, and propose random online backtranslation to enforce the translation of unseen training language pairs. Experiments on OPUS-100 (a novel multilingual dataset with 100 languages) show that our approach substantially narrows the performance gap with bilingual models in both oneto-many and many-to-many settings, and improves zero-shot performance by ∼10 BLEU, approaching conventional pivot-based methods. 1",,,
216562425,Recipes for building an open-domain chatbot,"Building open-domain chatbots is a challenging area for machine learning research. While prior work has shown that scaling neural models in the number of parameters and the size of the data they are trained on gives improved results, we show that other ingredients are important for a high-performing chatbot. Good conversation requires a number of skills that an expert conversationalist blends in a seamless way: providing engaging talking points and listening to their partners, and displaying knowledge, empathy and personality appropriately, while maintaining a consistent persona. We show that large scale models can learn these skills when given appropriate training data and choice of generation strategy. We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter models, and make our models and code publicly available. Human evaluations show our best models are superior to existing approaches in multi-turn dialogue in terms of engagingness and humanness measurements. We then discuss the limitations of this work by analyzing failure cases of our models.",,,
21671720,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018 LEVERAGING GRAMMAR AND REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR NEURAL PROGRAM SYNTHESIS,"Program synthesis is the task of automatically generating a program consistent with a specification. Recent years have seen proposal of a number of neural approaches for program synthesis, many of which adopt a sequence generation paradigm similar to neural machine translation, in which sequence-to-sequence models are trained to maximize the likelihood of known reference programs. While achieving impressive results, this strategy has two key limitations. First, it ignores Program Aliasing: the fact that many different programs may satisfy a given specification (especially with incomplete specifications such as a few input-output examples). By maximizing the likelihood of only a single reference program, it penalizes many semantically correct programs, which can adversely affect the synthesizer performance. Second, this strategy overlooks the fact that programs have a strict syntax that can be efficiently checked. To address the first limitation, we perform reinforcement learning on top of a supervised model with an objective that explicitly maximizes the likelihood of generating semantically correct programs. For addressing the second limitation, we introduce a training procedure that directly maximizes the probability of generating syntactically correct programs that fulfill the specification. We show that our contributions lead to improved accuracy of the models, especially in cases where the training data is limited.",,,
216914087,"Control, Generate, Augment: A Scalable Framework for Multi-Attribute Text Generation","We introduce CGA, a conditional VAE architecture, to control, generate, and augment text. CGA is able to generate natural English sentences controlling multiple semantic and syntactic attributes by combining adversarial learning with a context-aware loss and a cyclical word dropout routine. We demonstrate the value of the individual model components in an ablation study. The scalability of our approach is ensured through a single discriminator, independently of the number of attributes. We show high quality, diversity and attribute control in the generated sentences through a series of automatic and human assessments. As the main application of our work, we test the potential of this new NLG model in a data augmentation scenario. In a downstream NLP task, the sentences generated by our CGA model show significant improvements over a strong baseline, and a classification performance often comparable to adding same amount of additional real data.",,,

We introduce an attention-based sequence learning model for the task and investigate the effect of encoding sentence-vs. paragraph-level information. In contrast to all previous work, our model does not rely on hand-crafted rules or a sophisticated NLP pipeline; it is instead trainable end-to-end via sequenceto-sequence learning. Automatic evaluation results show that our system significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art rule-based system. In human evaluations, questions generated by our system are also rated as being more natural (i.e., grammaticality, fluency) and as more difficult to answer (in terms of syntactic and lexical divergence from the original text and reasoning needed to answer).",,,
21725691,Semantic Frame Parsing for Information Extraction : the CALOR corpus,"This paper presents a publicly available corpus of French encyclopedic history texts annotated according to the Berkeley FrameNet formalism. The main difference in our approach compared to previous works on semantic parsing with FrameNet is that we are not interested here in full text parsing but rather on partial parsing. The goal is to select from the FrameNet resources the minimal set of frames that are going to be useful for the applicative framework targeted, in our case Information Extraction from encyclopedic documents. Such an approach leverages the manual annotation of larger corpora than those obtained through full text parsing and therefore opens the door to alternative methods for Frame parsing than those used so far on the FrameNet 1.5 benchmark corpus. The approaches compared in this study rely on an integrated sequence labeling model which jointly optimizes frame identification and semantic role segmentation and identification. The models compared are CRFs and multitasks bi-LSTMs.",,,

We define argument aspect detection as a necessary method to allow this fine-granular control and crowdsource a dataset with 5,032 arguments annotated with aspects.

218487034,On Faithfulness and Factuality in Abstractive Summarization,"It is well known that the standard likelihood training and approximate decoding objectives in neural text generation models lead to less human-like responses for open-ended tasks such as language modeling and story generation. In this paper we have analyzed limitations of these models for abstractive document summarization and found that these models are highly prone to hallucinate content that is unfaithful to the input document. We conducted a large scale human evaluation of several neural abstractive summarization systems to better understand the types of hallucinations they produce. Our human annotators found substantial amounts of hallucinated content in all model generated summaries. However, our analysis does show that pretrained models are better summarizers not only in terms of raw metrics, i.e., ROUGE, but also in generating faithful and factual summaries as evaluated by humans. Furthermore, we show that textual entailment measures better correlate with faithfulness than standard metrics, potentially leading the way to automatic evaluation metrics as well as training and decoding criteria.",,,
218487319,We Need to Talk About Random Splits,"Gorman and Bedrick (2019) argued for using random splits rather than standard splits in NLP experiments. We argue that random splits, like standard splits, lead to overly optimistic performance estimates. We can also split data in biased or adversarial ways, e.g., training on short sentences and evaluating on long ones. Biased sampling has been used in domain adaptation to simulate real-world drift; this is known as the covariate shift assumption. In NLP, however, even worst-case splits, maximizing bias, often under-estimate the error observed on new samples of in-domain data, i.e., the data that models should minimally generalize to at test time. This invalidates the covariate shift assumption. Instead of using multiple random splits, future benchmarks should ideally include multiple, independent test sets instead; if infeasible, we argue that multiple biased splits leads to more realistic performance estimates than multiple random splits.",,,
218516743,A Top-Down Neural Architecture towards Text-Level Parsing of Discourse Rhetorical Structure,"Due to its great importance in deep natural language understanding and various down-stream applications, text-level parsing of discourse rhetorical structure (DRS) has been drawing more and more attention in recent years. However, all the previous studies on text-level discourse parsing adopt bottom-up approaches, which much limit the DRS determination on local information and fail to well benefit from global information of the overall discourse. In this paper, we justify from both computational and perceptive points-of-view that the top-down architecture is more suitable for textlevel DRS parsing. On the basis, we propose a top-down neural architecture toward text-level DRS parsing. In particular, we cast discourse parsing as a recursive split point ranking task, where a split point is classified to different levels according to its rank and the elementary discourse units (EDUs) associated with it are arranged accordingly. In this way, we can determine the complete DRS as a hierarchical tree structure via an encoder-decoder with an internal stack. Experimentation on both the English RST-DT corpus and the Chinese CDTB corpus shows the great effectiveness of our proposed top-down approach towards textlevel DRS parsing.",,,
218538004,"On Exposure Bias, Hallucination and Domain Shift in Neural Machine Translation","The standard training algorithm in neural machine translation (NMT) suffers from exposure bias, and alternative algorithms have been proposed to mitigate this. However, the practical impact of exposure bias is under debate. In this paper, we link exposure bias to another well-known problem in NMT, namely the tendency to generate hallucinations under domain shift. In experiments on three datasets with multiple test domains, we show that exposure bias is partially to blame for hallucinations, and that training with Minimum Risk Training, which avoids exposure bias, can mitigate this. Our analysis explains why exposure bias is more problematic under domain shift, and also links exposure bias to the beam search problem, i.e. performance deterioration with increasing beam size. Our results provide a new justification for methods that reduce exposure bias: even if they do not increase performance on in-domain test sets, they can increase model robustness to domain shift.",,,
218613673,Screenplay Quality Assessment: Can We Predict Who Gets Nominated?,"Deciding which scripts to turn into movies is a costly and time-consuming process for filmmakers. Thus, building a tool to aid script selection, an initial phase in movie production, can be very beneficial. Toward that goal, in this work, we present a method to evaluate the quality of a screenplay based on linguistic cues. We address this in a two-fold approach: (1) we define the task as predicting nominations of scripts at major film awards with the hypothesis that the peer-recognized scripts should have a greater chance to succeed.(2) based on industry opinions and narratology, we extract and integrate domain-specific features into common classification techniques. We face two challenges (1) scripts are much longer than other document datasets (2) nominated scripts are limited and thus difficult to collect. However, with narratology-inspired modeling and domain features, our approach offers clear improvements over strong baselines. Our work provides a new approach for future work in screenplay analysis.",,,
2187805,A NOTE ON THE EVALUATION OF GENERATIVE MODELS,"Probabilistic generative models can be used for compression, denoising, inpainting, texture synthesis, semi-supervised learning, unsupervised feature learning, and other tasks. Given this wide range of applications, it is not surprising that a lot of heterogeneity exists in the way these models are formulated, trained, and evaluated. As a consequence, direct comparison between models is often difficult. This article reviews mostly known but often underappreciated properties relating to the evaluation and interpretation of generative models with a focus on image models. In particular, we show that three of the currently most commonly used criteria-average log-likelihood, Parzen window estimates, and visual fidelity of samples-are largely independent of each other when the data is high-dimensional. Good performance with respect to one criterion therefore need not imply good performance with respect to the other criteria. Our results show that extrapolation from one criterion to another is not warranted and generative models need to be evaluated directly with respect to the application(s) they were intended for. In addition, we provide examples demonstrating that Parzen window estimates should generally be avoided.",,,
218862840,Evaluating Neural Morphological Taggers for Sanskrit,"Neural sequence labelling approaches have achieved state of the art results in morphological tagging. We evaluate the efficacy of four standard sequence labelling models on Sanskrit, a morphologically rich, fusional Indian language. As its label space can theoretically contain more than 40,000 labels, systems that explicitly model the internal structure of a label are more suited for the task, because of their ability to generalise to labels not seen during training. We find that although some neural models perform better than others, one of the common causes for error for all of these models is mispredictions due to syncretism. 1",,,
218901061,CausaLM: Causal Model Explanation Through Counterfactual Language Models under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license Computational Linguistics,"Understanding predictions made by deep neural networks is notoriously difficult, but also crucial to their dissemination. As all machine learning-based methods, they are as good as their training data, and can also capture unwanted biases. While there are tools that can help understand whether such biases exist, they do not distinguish between correlation and causation, and might be ill-suited for text-based models and for reasoning about high-level language concepts. A key problem of estimating the causal effect of a concept of interest on a given model is that this estimation requires the generation of counterfactual examples, which is challenging with existing generation technology. To bridge that gap, we propose CausaLM, a framework for producing causal model explanations using counterfactual language representation models. Our approach is based on fine-tuning of deep contextualized embedding models with auxiliary adversarial tasks derived from the causal graph of the problem. Concretely, we show that by carefully choosing Submission Volume 47, Number 2 auxiliary adversarial pre-training tasks, language representation models such as BERT can effectively learn a counterfactual representation for a given concept of interest, and be used to estimate its true causal effect on model performance. A byproduct of our method is a language representation model that is unaffected by the tested concept, which can be useful in mitigating unwanted bias ingrained in the data. 1",,,

219530980,DeCLUTR: Deep Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Textual Representations,"Sentence embeddings are an important component of many natural language processing (NLP) systems. Like word embeddings, sentence embeddings are typically learned on large text corpora and then transferred to various downstream tasks, such as clustering and retrieval. Unlike word embeddings, the highest performing solutions for learning sentence embeddings require labelled data, limiting their usefulness to languages and domains where labelled data is abundant. In this paper, we present DeCLUTR: Deep Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Textual Representations. Inspired by recent advances in deep metric learning (DML), we carefully design a self-supervised objective for learning universal sentence embeddings that does not require labelled training data. When used to extend the pretraining of transformer-based language models, our approach closes the performance gap between unsupervised and supervised pretraining for universal sentence encoders. Importantly, our experiments suggest that the quality of the learned embeddings scale with both the number of trainable parameters and the amount of unlabelled training data. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available and can be easily adapted to new domains or used to embed unseen text. 1",,,
219531522,FASTSPEECH 2: FAST AND HIGH-QUALITY END-TO- END TEXT TO SPEECH,"Non-autoregressive text to speech (TTS) models such as FastSpeech(Ren et al., 2019)can synthesize speech significantly faster than previous autoregressive models with comparable quality. The training of FastSpeech model relies on an autoregressive teacher model for duration prediction (to provide more information as input) and knowledge distillation (to simplify the data distribution in output), which can ease the one-to-many mapping problem (i.e., multiple speech variations correspond to the same text) in TTS. However, FastSpeech has several disadvantages: 1) the teacher-student distillation pipeline is complicated and time-consuming, 2) the duration extracted from the teacher model is not accurate enough, and the target mel-spectrograms distilled from teacher model suffer from information loss due to data simplification, both of which limit the voice quality. In this paper, we propose FastSpeech 2, which addresses the issues in FastSpeech and better solves the one-to-many mapping problem in TTS by 1) directly training the model with ground-truth target instead of the simplified output from teacher, and 2) introducing more variation information of speech (e.g., pitch, energy and more accurate duration) as conditional inputs. Specifically, we extract duration, pitch and energy from speech waveform and directly take them as conditional inputs in training and use predicted values in inference. We further design FastSpeech 2s, which is the first attempt to directly generate speech waveform from text in parallel, enjoying the benefit of fully end-to-end inference. Experimental results show that 1) FastSpeech 2 achieves a 3x training speed-up over FastSpeech, and FastSpeech 2s enjoys even faster inference speed; 2) FastSpeech 2 and 2s outperform FastSpeech in voice quality, and Fast-Speech 2 can even surpass autoregressive models. Audio samples are available at https://speechresearch.github.io/fastspeech2/. * Authors contribute equally to this work. † Corresponding author arXiv:2006.04558v8 [eess.AS] 8 Aug 2022 2019). They usually suffer from slow inference speed and robustness (word skipping and repeating) issues(Ren et al., 2019;Chen et al., 2020). In recent years, non-autoregressive TTS models(Ren et al., 2019;Łańcucki, 2020;Lim et al., 2020;Miao et al., 2020;are designed to address these issues, which generate mel-spectrograms with extremely fast speed and avoid robustness issues, while achieving comparable voice quality with previous autoregressive models.Among those non-autoregressive TTS methods, FastSpeech (Ren et al., 2019) is one of the most successful models. FastSpeech designs two ways to alleviate the one-to-many mapping problem: 1) Reducing data variance in the target side by using the generated mel-spectrogram from an autoregressive teacher model as the training target (i.e., knowledge distillation). 2) Introducing the duration information (extracted from the attention map of the teacher model) to expand the text sequence to match the length of the mel-spectrogram sequence. While these designs in FastSpeech ease the learning of the one-to-many mapping problem (see Section 2.1) in TTS, they also bring several disadvantages: 1) The two-stage teacher-student training pipeline makes the training process complicated.2) The target mel-spectrograms generated from the teacher model have some information loss 1 compared with the ground-truth ones, since the quality of the audio synthesized from the generated mel-spectrograms is usually worse than that from the ground-truth ones.3) The duration extracted from the attention map of teacher model is not accurate enough.",,,
219558760,On the Bottleneck of Graph Neural Networks and its Practical Implications,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) were shown to effectively learn from highly structured data containing elements (nodes) with relationships (edges) between them. GNN variants differ in how each node in the graph absorbs the information flowing from its neighbor nodes. In this paper, we highlight an inherent problem in GNNs: the mechanism of propagating information between neighbors creates a bottleneck when every node aggregates messages from its neighbors. This bottleneck causes the over-squashing of exponentially-growing information into fixed-size vectors. As a result, the graph fails to propagate messages flowing from distant nodes and performs poorly when the prediction task depends on long-range information. We demonstrate that the bottleneck hinders popular GNNs from fitting the training data. We show that GNNs that absorb incoming edges equally, like GCN and GIN, are more susceptible to over-squashing than other GNN types. We further show that existing, extensively-tuned, GNN-based models suffer from over-squashing and that breaking the bottleneck improves state-of-the-art results without any hyperparameter tuning or additional weights.Preprint.

219573654,Tangled up in BLEU: Reevaluating the Evaluation of Automatic Machine Translation Evaluation Metrics,"Automatic metrics are fundamental for the development and evaluation of machine translation systems. Judging whether, and to what extent, automatic metrics concur with the gold standard of human evaluation is not a straightforward problem. We show that current methods for judging metrics are highly sensitive to the translations used for assessment, particularly the presence of outliers, which often leads to falsely confident conclusions about a metric's efficacy. Finally, we turn to pairwise system ranking, developing a method for thresholding performance improvement under an automatic metric against human judgements, which allows quantification of type I versus type II errors incurred, i.e., insignificant human differences in system quality that are accepted, and significant human differences that are rejected. Together, these findings suggest improvements to the protocols for metric evaluation and system performance evaluation in machine translation.",,,
219686921,OPEN-DOMAIN QUESTION ANSWERING WITH PRE-CONSTRUCTED QUESTION SPACES,"Open-domain question answering aims at solving the task of locating the answers to user-generated questions in large collections of documents. There are two families of solutions to this challenge. One family of algorithms, namely retriever-readers, first retrieves some pieces of text that are probably relevant to the question, and then feeds the retrieved text to a neural network to get the answer. Another line of work first constructs some knowledge graphs from the corpus, and queries the graph for the answer. We propose a novel algorithm with a reader-retriever structure that differs from both families. Our algorithm first reads off-line the corpus to generate collections of all answerable questions associated with their answers, and then queries the pre-constructed question spaces online to find answers that are most likely to be asked in the given way. The final answer returned to the user is decided with an accept-or-reject mechanism that combines multiple candidate answers by comparing the level of agreement between the retriever-reader and reader-retriever results. We claim that our algorithm solves some bottlenecks in existing work, and demonstrate that it achieves superior accuracy on a public dataset.",,,

While several machine learning methods have been proposed to learn PDEs directly from data, previous methods are limited to discretetime approximations or make the limiting assumption of the observations arriving at regular grids. We propose a general continuous-time differential model for dynamical systems whose governing equations are parameterized by message passing graph neural networks. The model admits arbitrary space and time discretizations, which removes constraints on the locations of observation points and time intervals between the observations. The model is trained with continuous-time adjoint method enabling efficient neural PDE inference. We demonstrate the model's ability to work with unstructured grids, arbitrary time steps, and noisy observations. We compare our method with existing approaches on several well-known physical systems that involve first and higher-order PDEs with state-of-the-art predictive performance.Preprint. Under review.",,,
219721074,Categorical Normalizing Flows via Continuous Transformations,"Despite their popularity, to date, the application of normalizing flows on categorical data stays limited. The current practice of using dequantization to map discrete data to a continuous space is inapplicable as categorical data has no intrinsic order. Instead, categorical data have complex and latent relations that must be inferred, like the synonymy between words. In this paper, we investigate Categorical Normalizing Flows, that is normalizing flows for categorical data. By casting the encoding of categorical data in continuous space as a variational inference problem, we jointly optimize the continuous representation and the model likelihood. To maintain unique decoding, we learn a partitioning of the latent space by factorizing the posterior. Meanwhile, the complex relations between the categorical variables are learned by the ensuing normalizing flow, thus maintaining a close-to exact likelihood estimate and making it possible to scale up to a large number of categories. Based on Categorical Normalizing Flows, we propose GraphCNF a permutation-invariant generative model on graphs, outperforming both one-shot and autoregressive flow-based state-of-the-art on molecule generation. Preprint. Under review. arXiv:2006.09790v1 [cs.LG] 17 Jun 2020flow. As no information should be lost when mapping the data into continuous space, we limit the encoding distributions to ones whose (approximate) posterior is independent over discrete variables. This leads to a learned partitioning of the latent space with an almost unique decoding. We call this approach Categorical Normalizing Flows and experiment with encoding distributions of increasing flexibility, but find that a simple mixture model is sufficient for encoding categorical data well.Categorical Normalizing Flows can be applied to any task involving categorical variables. Examples, which we visit experimentally in this work, include words as categorical (one-hot vector) variables, sets and graphs[48,50]. We put particular emphasis on graphs, as current approaches are mostly autoregressive[18,36,49]and view graphs as sequences, although there exists no intrinsic order of the nodes. Normalizing flows, however, can perform generation in parallel making a definition of order unnecessary. By treating both nodes and edges as categorical variables, we employ our variational inference encoding and propose GraphCNF. GraphCNF is a novel permutation-invariant normalizing flow on graph generation which assigns equal likelihood to any ordering of nodes. Meanwhile, GraphCNF encodes the node attributes, edge attributes and graph structure in three consecutive steps. As shown in the experiments, the improved encoding and flow architecture allows GraphCNF to outperform significantly both the autoregressive and parallel flow-based state-of-the-art.Overall, our contributions are summarized as follows:• We propose Categorical Normalizing Flows, which apply a novel encoding method for categorical data in normalizing flows. By using variational inference with a factorized posterior, we still support an close-to exact likelihood estimate and scale up to large number of categories. • Starting from the Categorical Normalizing Flows, we propose GraphCNF, a permutationinvariant normalizing flow on graph generation. On molecule generation, GraphCNF sets a new state-of-the-art for flow-based methods outperforming one-shot and autoregressive baselines. • We experiment with encoding distributions of increasing flexibility on various tasks including sets, language and graphs, and show that a simple mixture model is sufficient for modeling discrete, categorical distribution accurately.",,,
219792420,Learning Invariant Representations for Reinforcement Learning without Reconstruction,"We study how representation learning can accelerate reinforcement learning from rich observations, such as images, without relying either on domain knowledge or pixel-reconstruction. Our goal is to learn representations that both provide for effective downstream control and invariance to task-irrelevant details. Bisimulation metrics quantify behavioral similarity between states in continuous MDPs, which we propose using to learn robust latent representations which encode only the task-relevant information from observations. Our method trains encoders such that distances in latent space equal bisimulation distances in state space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method at disregarding task-irrelevant information using modified visual MuJoCo tasks, where the background is replaced with moving distractors and natural videos, while achieving SOTA performance. We also test a first-person highway driving task where our method learns invariance to clouds, weather, and time of day. Finally, we provide generalization results drawn from properties of bisimulation metrics, and links to causal inference.Learning control from images is important for many real world applications. While deep reinforcement learning (RL) has enjoyed many successes in simulated tasks, learning control from real vision is more complex, especially outdoors, where images reveal detailed scenes of a complex and unstructured world. Furthermore, while many RL algorithms can eventually learn control from real images given unlimited data, data-efficiency is often a necessity in real trials which are expensive and constrained to real-time. Prior methods for data-efficient learning of simulated visual tasks typically use representation learning. Representation learning summarizes images by encoding them into smaller vectored representations better suited for RL. For example, sequential autoencoders aim to learn lossless representations of streaming observations-sufficient to reconstruct current observations and predict future observations-from which various RL algorithms can be trained[11,19,34]. However, such methods are task-agnostic: the models represent all dynamic elements they observe in the world, whether they are relevant to the task or not. We argue such representations can easily ""distract"" RL algorithms with irrelevant information in the case of real images. The issues of distraction is less evident in popular simulation MuJoCo and Atari tasks, since any change in observation space is likely task-relevant, and thus, worth representing. By contrast, visual images that autonomous cars observe contain predominately task-irrelevant information, like cloud shapes and architectural details, illustrated inFigure 1. * Equal contribution.",,,
220347683,Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding,"While BERT is an effective method for learning monolingual sentence embeddings for semantic similarity and embedding based transfer learning (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019), BERT based cross-lingual sentence embeddings have yet to be explored. We systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM), translation language modeling (TLM) (Conneau and Lample, 2019), dual encoder translation ranking (Guo et al., 2018), and additive margin softmax(Yang et al., 2019a). We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over 112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5% achieved by Artetxe and Schwenk (2019b), while still performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks (Conneau and Kiela, 2018).

Data-to-text annotations can be a costly process, especially when dealing with tables which are the major source of structured data and contain nontrivial structures. To this end, we propose a procedure of extracting semantic triples from tables that encodes their structures by exploiting the semantic dependencies among table headers and the table title. Our dataset construction framework effectively merged heterogeneous sources from open domain semantic parsing and spoken dialogue systems by utilizing techniques including tree ontology annotation, question-answer pair to declarative sentence conversion and predicate unification, all with minimum post-editing. We present systematic evaluation on DART as well as new state-of-the-art results on WebNLG 2017 to show that DART (1) poses new challenges to existing data-to-text datasets and (2) facilitates out-of-domain generalization.

220403547,How benign is benign overfitting?,"We investigate two causes for adversarial vulnerability in deep neural networks: bad data and (poorly) trained models. When trained with SGD, deep neural networks essentially achieve zero training error, even in the presence of label noise, while also exhibiting good generalization on natural test data, something referred to as benign overfitting [2, 10]. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We identify label noise as one of the causes for adversarial vulnerability, and provide theoretical and empirical evidence in support of this. Surprisingly, we find several instances of label noise in datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR, and that robustly trained models incur training error on some of these, i.e. they don't fit the noise. However, removing noisy labels alone does not suffice to achieve adversarial robustness. Standard training procedures bias neural networks towards learning ""simple"" classification boundaries, which may be less robust than more complex ones. We observe that adversarial training does produce more complex decision boundaries. We conjecture that in part the need for complex decision boundaries arises from sub-optimal representation learning. By means of simple toy examples, we show theoretically how the choice of representation can drastically affect adversarial robustness.",,,
220769181,DOP: Off-Policy Multi-Agent Decomposed Policy Gradients,"Recently, multi-agent policy gradient (MAPG) methods witness vigorous progress. However, there is a discrepancy between the performance of MAPG methods and state-of-the-art multi-agent value-based approaches. In this paper, we investigate the causes that hinder the performance of MAPG algorithms and present a multiagent decomposed policy gradient method (DOP). This method introduces the idea of value function decomposition into the multi-agent actor-critic framework. Based on this idea, DOP supports efficient off-policy learning and addresses the issue of centralized-decentralized mismatch and credit assignment in both discrete and continuous action spaces. We formally show that DOP critics have sufficient representational capability to guarantee convergence. In addition, empirical evaluations on the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark and multi-agent particle environments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art value-based and policy-based multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms.

220935959,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 QPLEX: DUPLEX DUELING MULTI-AGENT Q-LEARNING,"We explore value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in the popular paradigm of centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). CTDE has an important concept, Individual-Global-Max (IGM) principle, which requires the consistency between joint and local action selections to support efficient local decision-making. However, in order to achieve scalability, existing MARL methods either limit representation expressiveness of their value function classes or relax the IGM consistency, which may suffer from instability risk or may not perform well in complex domains. This paper presents a novel MARL approach, called duPLEX dueling multi-agent Q-learning (QPLEX), which takes a duplex dueling network architecture to factorize the joint value function. This duplex dueling structure encodes the IGM principle into the neural network architecture and thus enables efficient value function learning. Theoretical analysis shows that QPLEX achieves a complete IGM function class. Empirical experiments on StarCraft II micromanagement tasks demonstrate that QPLEX significantly outperforms stateof-the-art baselines in both online and offline data collection settings, and also reveal that QPLEX achieves high sample efficiency and can benefit from offline datasets without additional online exploration 1 . * Equal contribution.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 ∞ t=0 γ t r t |s 0 = s, π].

221005781,Question and Answer Test-Train Overlap in Open-Domain Question Answering Datasets,"Ideally Open-Domain Question Answering models should exhibit a number of competencies, ranging from simply memorizing questions seen at training time, to answering novel question formulations with answers seen during training, to generalizing to completely novel questions with novel answers. However, single aggregated test set scores do not show the full picture of what capabilities models truly have. In this work, we perform a detailed study of the test sets of three popular open-domain benchmark datasets with respect to these competencies. We find that 60-70% of test-time answers are also present somewhere in the training sets. We also find that 30% of test-set questions have a near-duplicate paraphrase in their corresponding training sets. Using these findings, we evaluate a variety of popular open-domain models to obtain greater insight into what extent they can actually generalize, and what drives their overall performance. We find that all models perform dramatically worse on questions that cannot be memorized from training sets, with a mean absolute performance difference of 63% between repeated and non-repeated data. Finally we show that simple nearest-neighbor models outperform a BART closed-book QA model, further highlighting the role that training set memorization plays in these benchmarks.",,,
221376626,SOLAR: Sparse Orthogonal Learned and Random Embeddings,"Dense embedding models are commonly deployed in commercial search engines, wherein all the document vectors are pre-computed, and near-neighbor search (NNS) is performed with the query vector to find relevant documents. However, the bottleneck of indexing a large number of dense vectors and performing an NNS hurts the query time and accuracy of these models. In this paper, we argue that highdimensional and ultra-sparse embedding is a significantly superior alternative to dense low-dimensional embedding for both query efficiency and accuracy. Extreme sparsity eliminates the need for NNS by replacing them with simple lookups, while its high dimensionality ensures that the embeddings are informative even when sparse. However, learning extremely high dimensional embeddings leads to blow up in the model size. To make the training feasible, we propose a partitioning algorithm that learns such high dimensional embeddings across multiple GPUs without any communication. This is facilitated by our novel asymmetric mixture of Sparse, Orthogonal, Learned and Random (SOLAR) Embeddings. The label vectors are random, sparse, and near-orthogonal by design, while the query vectors are learned and sparse. We theoretically prove that our way of one-sided learning is equivalent to learning both query and label embeddings. With these unique properties, we can successfully train 500K dimensional SOLAR embeddings for the tasks of searching through 1.6M books and multi-label classification on the three largest public datasets. We achieve superior precision and recall compared to the respective state-of-the-art baselines for each task with up to 10× faster speed.Preprint. Under review.",,,
221507798,KILT: a Benchmark for Knowledge Intensive Language Tasks,"Challenging problems such as open-domain question answering, fact checking, slot filling and entity linking require access to large, external knowledge sources. While some models do well on individual tasks, developing general models is difficult as each task might require computationally expensive indexing of custom knowledge sources, in addition to dedicated infrastructure. To catalyze research on models that condition on specific information in large textual resources, we present a benchmark for knowledge-intensive language tasks (KILT). All tasks in KILT are grounded in the same snapshot of Wikipedia, reducing engineering turnaround through the reuse of components, as well as accelerating research into task-agnostic memory architectures. We test both task-specific and general baselines, evaluating downstream performance in addition to the ability of the models to provide provenance. We find that a shared dense vector index coupled with a seq2seq model is a strong baseline, outperforming more tailor-made approaches for fact checking, open-domain question answering and dialogue, and yielding competitive results on entity linking and slot filling, by generating disambiguated text.

221508448,MULTI-TIME ATTENTION NETWORKS FOR IRREGULARLY SAMPLED TIME SERIES,"Irregular sampling occurs in many time series modeling applications where it presents a significant challenge to standard deep learning models. This work is motivated by the analysis of physiological time series data in electronic health records, which are sparse, irregularly sampled, and multivariate. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework for this setting that we call Multi-Time Attention Networks. Multi-Time Attention Networks learn an embedding of continuous time values and use an attention mechanism to produce a fixed-length representation of a time series containing a variable number of observations. We investigate the performance of this framework on interpolation and classification tasks using multiple datasets. Our results show that the proposed approach performs as well or better than a range of baseline and recently proposed models while offering significantly faster training times than current state-of-the-art methods. 1 1 Implementation available at : https://github.com/reml-lab/mTAN 1 arXiv:2101.10318v2 [cs.LG] 7 Jun 2021Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021The main contributions of the mTAN model framework are: (1) It provides a flexible approach to modeling multivariate, sparse and irregularly sampled time series data (including irregularly sampled time series of partially observed vectors) by leveraging a time attention mechanism to learn temporal similarity from data instead of using fixed kernels. (2) It uses a temporally distributed latent representation to better capture local structure in time series data. (3) It provides interpolation and classification performance that is as good as current state-of-the-art methods or better, while providing significantly reduced training times.RELATED WORKAn irregularly sampled time series is a time series with irregular time intervals between observations. In the multivariate setting, there can also be a lack of alignment across different variables within the same multivariate time series. Finally, when gaps between observation times are large, the time series is also considered to be sparse. Such data occur in electronic health records (Marlin et al.,  astronomy (Scargle, 1982). It is well understood that such data cause significant issues for standard supervised machine learning models that typically assume fully observed, fixed-size feature representations(Marlin et al., 2012).A basic approach to dealing with irregular sampling is fixed temporal discretization. For example,Marlin et al. (2012)and Lipton et al. (2016) discretize continuous-time observations into hour-long bins. This has the advantage of simplicity, but requires ad-hoc handling of bins with more than one observation and results in missing data when bins are empty.",,,
221703752,MLMLM: Link Prediction with Mean Likelihood Masked Language Model,"Knowledge Bases (KBs) are easy to query, verifiable, and interpretable. They however scale with man-hours and high-quality data. Masked Language Models (MLMs), such as BERT, scale with computing power as well as unstructured raw text data. The knowledge contained within those models is however not directly interpretable. We propose to perform link prediction with MLMs to address both the KBs scalability issues and the MLMs interpretability issues. To do that we introduce MLMLM, Mean Likelihood Masked Language Model, an approach comparing the mean likelihood of generating the different entities to perform link prediction in a tractable manner. We obtain State of the Art (SotA) results on the WN18RR dataset and the best nonentity-embedding based results on the FB15k-237 dataset. We also obtain convincing results on link prediction on previously unseen entities, making MLMLM a suitable approach to introducing new entities to a KB.",,,
221739153,ON THE CURSE OF MEMORY IN RECURRENT NEU- RAL NETWORKS: APPROXIMATION AND OPTIMIZA- TION ANALYSIS,"We study the approximation properties and optimization dynamics of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) when applied to learn input-output relationships in temporal data. We consider the simple but representative setting of using continuoustime linear RNNs to learn from data generated by linear relationships. Mathematically, the latter can be understood as a sequence of linear functionals. We prove a universal approximation theorem of such linear functionals and characterize the approximation rate. Moreover, we perform a fine-grained dynamical analysis of training linear RNNs by gradient methods. A unifying theme uncovered is the non-trivial effect of memory, a notion that can be made precise in our framework, on both approximation and optimization: when there is long-term memory in the target, it takes a large number of neurons to approximate it. Moreover, the training process will suffer from slow downs. In particular, both of these effects become exponentially more pronounced with increasing memory -a phenomenon we call the ""curse of memory"". These analyses represent a basic step towards a concrete mathematical understanding of new phenomenons that may arise in learning temporal relationships using recurrent architectures. † Equal contribution ‡ Corresponding author arXiv:2009.07799v2 [cs.LG] 16 May 2021Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 here is the presence of temporal dynamics in terms of both the recurrent architectures in the model and the dynamical structures in the data. Hence, to understand the influence of dynamics on learning is of fundamental importance. As is often the case, the key effects of dynamics can already be revealed in the simplest linear setting. For this reason, we will focus our analysis on linear RNNs, i.e. those with linear activations. Further, we will employ a continuous-time analysis initially studied in the context of feed-forward architectures (E, 2017; Haber & Ruthotto, 2017; Li et al., 2017)   and recently in recurrent settings (Ceni et al., 2019; Chang et al., 2019; Lim, 2020; Sherstinsky,  2018; Niu et al., 2019; Herrera et al., 2020; Rubanova et al., 2019)  and idealize the RNN as a continuous-time dynamical system. This allows us to phrase the problems under investigation in convenient analytical settings that accentuates the effect of dynamics. In this case, the RNNs serve to approximate relationships represented by sequences of linear functionals. On first look the setting appears to be simple, but we show that it yields representative results that underlie key differences in the dynamical setting as opposed to static supervised learning problems. In fact, we show that memory, which can be made precise by the decay rates of the target linear functionals, can affect both approximation rates and optimization dynamics in a non-trivial way.Our main results are:Here, {h k } are the hidden/latent states and its evolution is governed by a recursive application of a feed-forward layer with activation σ, andŷ k is called the observation or readout. We omit the bias term here and only consider a linear readout or output layer. For each time step k, the mapping {x 0 , . . . , x k−1 } →ŷ k parameterizes a functionĤ k (·) through adjustable parameters (c, W, U ). Hence, for a particular choice of these parameters, a sequence of functions {Ĥ k } is constructed at the same time. To understand the working principles of RNNs, we need to characterize how {Ĥ k } approximates {H k }.The model(2)is not easy to analyze due to its discrete iterative nature. Hence, here we employ a continuous-time idealization that replaces the time-step index k by a continuous time parameter t. This allows us to employ a large variety of continuum analysis tools to gain insights to the learning problem. Let us now introduce this framework.Continuous-time formulation. Consider a sequence of inputs indexed by a real-valued variable t ∈ R instead of a discrete variable k considered previously.

221836121,ALICE: Active Learning with Contrastive Natural Language Explanations,"Training a supervised neural network classifier typically requires many annotated training samples. Collecting and annotating a large number of data points are costly and sometimes even infeasible. Traditional annotation process uses a low-bandwidth human-machine communication interface: classification labels, each of which only provides a few bits of information. We propose Active Learning with Contrastive Explanations (ALICE), an expert-in-the-loop training framework that utilizes contrastive natural language explanations to improve data efficiency in learning. AL-ICE learns to first use active learning to select the most informative pairs of label classes to elicit contrastive natural language explanations from experts. Then it extracts knowledge from these explanations using a semantic parser. Finally, it incorporates the extracted knowledge through dynamically changing the learning model's structure. We applied ALICE in two visual recognition tasks, bird species classification and social relationship classification. We found by incorporating contrastive explanations, our models outperform baseline models that are trained with 40-100% more training data. We found that adding 1 explanation leads to similar performance gain as adding 13-30 labeled training data points.",,,

222090060,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 INTERPRETING GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS FOR NLP WITH DIFFERENTIABLE EDGE MASKING,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular approach to integrating structural inductive biases into NLP models. However, there has been little work on interpreting them, and specifically on understanding which parts of the graphs (e.g. syntactic trees or co-reference structures) contribute to a prediction. In this work, we introduce a post-hoc method for interpreting the predictions of GNNs which identifies unnecessary edges. Given a trained GNN model, we learn a simple classifier that, for every edge in every layer, predicts if that edge can be dropped. We demonstrate that such a classifier can be trained in a fully differentiable fashion, employing stochastic gates and encouraging sparsity through the expected L 0 norm. We use our technique as an attribution method to analyse GNN models for two tasks -question answering and semantic role labelling -providing insights into the information flow in these models. We show that we can drop a large proportion of edges without deteriorating the performance of the model, while we can analyse the remaining edges for interpreting model predictions.",,,
222124972,FASTER BINARY EMBEDDINGS FOR PRESERVING EUCLIDEAN DISTANCES,"We propose a fast, distance-preserving, binary embedding algorithm to transform a high-dimensional dataset T ⊆ R n into binary sequences in the cube {±1} m . When T consists of well-spread (i.e., non-sparse) vectors, our embedding method applies a stable noise-shaping quantization scheme to Ax where A ∈ R m×n is a sparse Gaussian random matrix. This contrasts with most binary embedding methods, which usually use x → sign(Ax) for the embedding. Moreover, we show that Euclidean distances among the elements of T are approximated by the 1 norm on the images of {±1} m under a fast linear transformation. This again contrasts with standard methods, where the Hamming distance is used instead. Our method is both fast and memory efficient, with time complexity O(m) and space complexity O(m). Further, we prove that the method is accurate and its associated error is comparable to that of a continuous valued Johnson-Lindenstrauss embedding plus a quantization error that admits a polynomial decay as the embedding dimension m increases. Thus the length of the binary codes required to achieve a desired accuracy is quite small, and we show it can even be compressed further without compromising the accuracy. To illustrate our results, we test the proposed method on natural images and show that it achieves strong performance.",,,

However, if we want to build agents with human-like abilities, we must expand beyond handling just text. A particularly important topic is the ability to see images and communicate about what is perceived. With the goal of getting humans to engage in multi-modal dialogue, we investigate combining components from state-of-the-art open-domain dialogue agents with those from state-of-the-art vision models. We study incorporating different image fusion schemes and domain-adaptive pre-training and fine-tuning strategies, and show that our best resulting model outperforms strong existing models in multi-modal dialogue while simultaneously performing as well as its predecessor (text-only) BlenderBot (Roller et al., 2020)   in text-based conversation.

World models facilitate such generalization and allow learning behaviors from imagined outcomes to increase sample-efficiency. While learning world models from image inputs has recently become feasible for some tasks, modeling Atari games accurately enough to derive successful behaviors has remained an open challenge for many years. We introduce DreamerV2, a reinforcement learning agent that learns behaviors purely from predictions in the compact latent space of a powerful world model. The world model uses discrete representations and is trained separately from the policy. DreamerV2 constitutes the first agent that achieves human-level performance on the Atari benchmark of 55 tasks by learning behaviors inside a separately trained world model. With the same computational budget and wall-clock time, Dreamer V2 reaches 200M frames and surpasses the final performance of the top single-GPU agents IQN and Rainbow. DreamerV2 is also applicable to tasks with continuous actions, where it learns an accurate world model of a complex humanoid robot and solves stand-up and walking from only pixel inputs.",,,
222133372,Async-RED: A Provably Convergent Asynchronous Block Parallel Stochastic Method using Deep Denoising Priors,"Regularization by denoising (RED) is a recently developed framework for solving inverse problems by integrating advanced denoisers as image priors. Recent work has shown its state-of-the-art performance when combined with pre-trained deep denoisers. However, current RED algorithms are inadequate for parallel processing on multicore systems. We address this issue by proposing a new asynchronous RED (ASYNC-RED) algorithm that enables asynchronous parallel processing of data, making it significantly faster than its serial counterparts for large-scale inverse problems. The computational complexity of ASYNC-RED is further reduced by using a random subset of measurements at every iteration. We present complete theoretical analysis of the algorithm by establishing its convergence under explicit assumptions on the data-fidelity and the denoiser.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in neural architectures that are invariant or equivariant to all three shape-preserving transformations of point clouds: translation, rotation, and permutation. In this paper, we present a first study of the approximation power of these architectures. We first derive two sufficient conditions for an equivariant architecture to have the universal approximation property, based on a novel characterization of the space of equivariant polynomials.

222140735,On the Role of Supervision in Unsupervised Constituency Parsing,"We analyze several recent unsupervised constituency parsing models, which are tuned with respect to the parsing F 1 score on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) development set (1,700 sentences). We introduce strong baselines for them, by training an existing supervised parsing model (Kitaev and Klein, 2018) on the same labeled examples they access. When training on the 1,700 examples, or even when using only 50 examples for training and 5 for development, such a few-shot parsing approach can outperform all the unsupervised parsing methods by a significant margin. Fewshot parsing can be further improved by a simple data augmentation method and selftraining. This suggests that, in order to arrive at fair conclusions, we should carefully consider the amount of labeled data used for model development. We propose two protocols for future work on unsupervised parsing: (i) use fully unsupervised criteria for hyperparameter tuning and model selection; (ii) use as few labeled examples as possible for model development, and compare to few-shot parsing trained on the same labeled examples. 1",,,

222208998,"Don't Parse, Insert: Multilingual Semantic Parsing with Insertion Based Decoding","Semantic parsing is one of the key components of natural language understanding systems. A successful parse transforms an input utterance to an action that is easily understood by the system. Many algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem, from conventional rulebased or statistical slot-filling systems to shiftreduce based neural parsers. For complex parsing tasks, the state-of-the-art method is based on autoregressive sequence to sequence models to generate the parse directly. This model is slow at inference time, generating parses in O(n) decoding steps (n is the length of the target sequence). In addition, we demonstrate that this method performs poorly in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning settings. In this paper, we propose a non-autoregressive parser which is based on the insertion transformer to overcome these two issues. Our approach 1) speeds up decoding by 3x while outperforming the autoregressive model and 2) significantly improves cross-lingual transfer in the low-resource setting by 37% compared to autoregressive baseline.

We study the problem of finetuning pre-trained LMs using only weak supervision, without any labeled data. This problem is challenging because the high capacity of LMs makes them prone to overfitting the noisy labels generated by weak supervision.To address this problem, we develop a contrastive self-training framework, COSINE, to enable fine-tuning LMs with weak supervision. Underpinned by contrastive regularization and confidence-based reweighting, our framework gradually improves model fitting while effectively suppressing error propagation.

222378161,Understanding Neural Abstractive Summarization Models via Uncertainty,"An advantage of seq2seq abstractive summarization models is that they generate text in a free-form manner, but this flexibility makes it difficult to interpret model behavior. In this work, we analyze summarization decoders in both blackbox and whitebox ways by studying on the entropy, or uncertainty, of the model's token-level predictions. For two strong pretrained models, PEGASUS (Zhang et al., 2020) and BART (Lewis et al., 2020) on two summarization datasets, we find a strong correlation between low prediction entropy and where the model copies tokens rather than generating novel text. The decoder's uncertainty also connects to factors like sentence position and syntactic distance between adjacent pairs of tokens, giving a sense of what factors make a context particularly selective for the model's next output token. Finally, we study the relationship of decoder uncertainty and attention behavior to understand how attention gives rise to these observed effects in the model. We show that uncertainty is a useful perspective for analyzing summarization and text generation models more broadly. 1",,,
222379753,SELF-TRAINING FOR FEW-SHOT TRANSFER ACROSS EXTREME TASK DIFFERENCES,"All few-shot learning techniques must be pre-trained on a large, labeled ""base dataset"". In problem domains where such large labeled datasets are not available for pre-training (e.g., X-ray images), one must resort to pre-training in a different ""source"" problem domain (e.g., ImageNet), which can be very different from the desired target task. Traditional few-shot and transfer learning techniques fail in the presence of such extreme differences between the source and target tasks. In this paper, we present a simple and effective solution to tackle this extreme domain gap: self-training a source domain representation on unlabeled data from the target domain. We show that this improves one-shot performance on the target domain by 2.9 points on average on a challenging benchmark with multiple domains.",,,
2239324,Are You Sure That This Happened? Assessing the Factuality Degree of Events in Text,"Identifying the veracity, or factuality, of event mentions in text is fundamental for reasoning about eventualities in discourse. Inferences derived from events judged as not having happened, or as being only possible, are different from those derived from events evaluated as factual. Event factuality involves two separate levels of information. On the one hand, it deals with polarity, which distinguishes between positive and negative instantiations of events. On the other, it has to do with degrees of certainty (e.g., possible, probable), an information level generally subsumed under the category of epistemic modality. This article aims at contributing to a better understanding of how event factuality is articulated in natural language. For that purpose, we put forward a linguistic-oriented computational model which has at its core an algorithm articulating the effect of factuality relations across levels of syntactic embedding. As a proof of concept, this model has been implemented in De Facto, a factuality profiler for eventualities mentioned in text, and tested against a corpus built specifically for the task, yielding an F 1 of 0.70 (macro-averaging) and 0.80 (micro-averaging). These two measures mutually compensate for an over-emphasis present in the other (either on the lesser or greater populated categories), and can therefore be interpreted as the lower and upper bounds of the De Facto's performance.",,,
223953416,GSum: A General Framework for Guided Neural Abstractive Summarization,"Neural abstractive summarization models are flexible and can produce coherent summaries, but they are sometimes unfaithful and can be difficult to control. While previous studies attempt to provide different types of guidance to control the output and increase faithfulness, it is not clear how these strategies compare and contrast to each other. In this paper, we propose a general and extensible guided summarization framework (GSum) that can effectively take different kinds of external guidance as input, and we perform experiments across several different varieties. Experiments demonstrate that this model is effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance according to ROUGE on 4 popular summarization datasets when using highlighted sentences as guidance. In addition, we show that our guided model can generate more faithful summaries and demonstrate how different types of guidance generate qualitatively different summaries, lending a degree of controllability to the learned models. 1",,,
223953610,What Can You Learn from Your Muscles? Learning Visual Representation from Human Interactions,"Learning effective representations of visual data that generalize to a variety of downstream tasks has been a long quest for computer vision. Most representation learning approaches rely solely on visual data such as images or videos. In this paper, we explore a novel approach, where we use human interaction and attention cues to investigate whether we can learn better representations compared to visual-only representations. For this study, we collect a dataset of human interactions capturing body part movements and gaze in their daily lives. Our experiments show that our self-supervised representation that encodes interaction and attention cues outperforms a visual-only state-of-the-art method MoCo (He et al., 2020), on a variety of target tasks: scene classification (semantic), action recognition (temporal), depth estimation (geometric), dynamics prediction (physics) and walkable surface estimation (affordance).Figure 1: We propose to use human's interactions with their visual surrounding as a training signal for self-supervised representation learning.

224725731,Example-Driven Intent Prediction with Observers,"A key challenge of dialog systems research is to effectively and efficiently adapt to new domains. A scalable paradigm for adaptation necessitates the development of generalizable models that perform well in few-shot settings. In this paper, we focus on the intent classification problem which aims to identify user intents given utterances addressed to the dialog system. We propose two approaches for improving the generalizability of utterance classification models: (1) observers and (2) example-driven training. Prior work has shown that BERT-like models tend to attribute a significant amount of attention to the [CLS]   token, which we hypothesize results in diluted representations. Observers are tokens that are not attended to, and are an alternative to the [CLS] token as a semantic representation of utterances. Example-driven training learns to classify utterances by comparing to examples, thereby using the underlying encoder as a sentence similarity model. These methods are complementary; improving the representation through observers allows the example-driven model to better measure sentence similarities. When combined, the proposed methods attain state-of-the-art results on three intent prediction datasets (BANKING77, CLINC150,  HWU64)  in both the full data and few-shot (10 examples per intent) settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can transfer to new intents and across datasets without any additional training.",,,
224818197,Analyzing the Source and Target Contributions to Predictions in Neural Machine Translation,"In Neural Machine Translation (and, more generally, conditional language modeling), the generation of a target token is influenced by two types of context: the source and the prefix of the target sequence. While many attempts to understand the internal workings of NMT models have been made, none of them explicitly evaluates relative source and target contributions to a generation decision. We argue that this relative contribution can be evaluated by adopting a variant of Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Its underlying 'conservation principle' makes relevance propagation unique: differently from other methods, it evaluates not an abstract quantity reflecting token importance, but the proportion of each token's influence. We extend LRP to the Transformer and conduct an analysis of NMT models which explicitly evaluates the source and target relative contributions to the generation process. We analyze changes in these contributions when conditioning on different types of prefixes, when varying the training objective or the amount of training data, and during the training process. We find that models trained with more data tend to rely on source information more and to have more sharp token contributions; the training process is non-monotonic with several stages of different nature. 1",,,

But can richer supervision help even more? To explore the utility of fine-grained, lexical-level supervision, we introduce SQUALL, a dataset that enriches 11,276 WIKITABLEQUESTIONS English-language questions with manually created SQL equivalents plus alignments between SQL and question fragments. Our annotation enables new training possibilities for encoderdecoder models, including approaches from machine translation previously precluded by the absence of alignments. We propose and test two methods: (1) supervised attention;(2) adopting an auxiliary objective of disambiguating references in the input queries to table columns. In 5-fold cross validation, these strategies improve over strong baselines by 4.4% execution accuracy. Oracle experiments suggest that annotated alignments can support further accuracy gains of up to 23.9%.",,,

A model needs to correctly recognize natural language references to columns and values and to ground them in the given database schema. In this paper, we present a novel weakly supervised Structure-Grounded pretraining framework (STRUG) for text-to-SQL that can effectively learn to capture text-table alignment based on a parallel text-table corpus. We identify a set of novel pretraining tasks: column grounding, value grounding and columnvalue mapping, and leverage them to pretrain a text-table encoder. Additionally, to evaluate different methods under more realistic text-table alignment settings, we create a new evaluation set Spider-Realistic based on Spider dev set with explicit mentions of column names removed, and adopt eight existing textto-SQL datasets for cross-database evaluation. STRUG brings significant improvement over BERT LARGE in all settings. Compared with existing pretraining methods such as GRAPPA, STRUG achieves similar performance on Spider, and outperforms all baselines on more realistic sets.

225067563,X-Class: Text Classification with Extremely Weak Supervision,"In this paper, we explore text classification with extremely weak supervision, i.e., only relying on the surface text of class names. This is a more challenging setting than the seed-driven weak supervision, which allows a few seed words per class. We opt to attack this problem from a representation learning perspective-ideal document representations should lead to nearly the same results between clustering and the desired classification. In particular, one can classify the same corpus differently (e.g., based on topics and locations), so document representations should be adaptive to the given class names. We propose a novel framework X-Class to realize the adaptive representations. Specifically, we first estimate class representations by incrementally adding the most similar word to each class until inconsistency arises. Following a tailored mixture of class attention mechanisms, we obtain the document representation via a weighted average of contextualized word representations. With the prior of each document assigned to its nearest class, we then cluster and align the documents to classes. Finally, we pick the most confident documents from each cluster to train a text classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-Class can rival and even outperform seed-driven weakly supervised methods on 7 benchmark datasets.",,,
225068405,Nonseparable Symplectic Neural Networks,"Predicting the behaviors of Hamiltonian systems has been drawing increasing attention in scientific machine learning. However, the vast majority of the literature was focused on predicting separable Hamiltonian systems with their kinematic and potential energy terms being explicitly decoupled while building data-driven paradigms to predict nonseparable Hamiltonian systems that are ubiquitous in fluid dynamics and quantum mechanics were rarely explored. The main computational challenge lies in the effective embedding of symplectic priors to describe the inherently coupled evolution of position and momentum, which typically exhibits intricate dynamics. To solve the problem, we propose a novel neural network architecture, Nonseparable Symplectic Neural Networks (NSSNNs), to uncover and embed the symplectic structure of a nonseparable Hamiltonian system from limited observation data. The enabling mechanics of our approach is an augmented symplectic time integrator to decouple the position and momentum energy terms and facilitate their evolution. We demonstrated the efficacy and versatility of our method by predicting a wide range of Hamiltonian systems, both separable and nonseparable, including chaotic vortical flows. We showed the unique computational merits of our approach to yield long-term, accurate, and robust predictions for large-scale Hamiltonian systems by rigorously enforcing symplectomor-",,,

However, training these models can be costly both from an economic and environmental standpoint. In this work, we investigate how to effectively use unlabeled data: by exploring the task-specific semi-supervised approach, Cross-View Training (CVT) and comparing it with task-agnostic BERT in multiple settings that include domain and task relevant English data. CVT uses a much lighter model architecture and we show that it achieves similar performance to BERT on a set of sequence tagging tasks, with lesser financial and environmental impact.",,,
226226888,Pre-print MIXKD: TOWARDS EFFICIENT DISTILLATION OF LARGE-SCALE LANGUAGE MODELS,"Large-scale language models have recently demonstrated impressive empirical performance. Nevertheless, the improved results are attained at the price of bigger models, more power consumption, and slower inference, which hinder their applicability to low-resource (memory and computation) platforms. Knowledge distillation (KD) has been demonstrated as an effective framework for compressing such big models. However, large-scale neural network systems are prone to memorize training instances, and thus tend to make inconsistent predictions when the data distribution is altered slightly. Moreover, the student model has few opportunities to request useful information from the teacher model when there is limited task-specific data available. To address these issues, we propose MixKD, a data-agnostic distillation framework that leverages mixup, a simple yet efficient data augmentation approach, to endow the resulting model with stronger generalization ability. Concretely, in addition to the original training examples, the student model is encouraged to mimic the teacher's behavior on the linear interpolation of example pairs as well. We prove, from a theoretical perspective, that under reasonable conditions MixKD gives rise to a smaller gap between the generalization error and the empirical error. To verify its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on the GLUE benchmark, where MixKD consistently leads to significant gains over the standard KD training, and outperforms several competitive baselines. Experiments under a limited-data setting and ablation studies further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach. * Equal contribution 1 arXiv:2011.00593v1 [cs.CL] 1 Nov 2020",,,
226254532,LEARNING AND EVALUATING REPRESENTATIONS FOR DEEP ONE-CLASS CLASSIFICATION,"We present a two-stage framework for deep one-class classification. We first learn self-supervised representations from one-class data, and then build one-class classifiers on learned representations. The framework not only allows to learn better representations, but also permits building one-class classifiers that are faithful to the target task. In particular, we present a novel distribution-augmented contrastive learning that extends training distributions via data augmentation to obstruct the uniformity of contrastive representations. Moreover, we argue that classifiers inspired by the statistical perspective in generative or discriminative models are more effective than existing approaches, such as an average of normality scores from a surrogate classifier. In experiments, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on visual domain one-class classification benchmarks.

226254579,Detecting Hallucinated Content in Conditional Neural Sequence Generation,"Neural sequence models can generate highly fluent sentences, but recent studies have also shown that they are also prone to hallucinate additional content not supported by the input. These variety of fluent but wrong outputs are particularly problematic, as it will not be possible for users to tell they are being presented incorrect content. To detect these errors, we propose a task to predict whether each token in the output sequence is hallucinated (not contained in the input) and collect new manually annotated evaluation sets for this task. We also introduce a method for learning to detect hallucinations using pretrained language models fine tuned on synthetic data that includes automatically inserted hallucinations Experiments on machine translation (MT) and abstractive summarization demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines on all benchmark datasets. We further demonstrate how to use the token-level hallucination labels to define a fine-grained loss over the target sequence in low-resource MT and achieve significant improvements over strong baseline methods.We also apply our method to word-level quality estimation for MT and show its effectiveness in both supervised and unsupervised settings 1 .",,,
226278255,Machine Generation and Detection of Arabic Manipulated and Fake News,"Fake news and deceptive machine-generated text are serious problems threatening modern societies, including in the Arab world. This motivates work on detecting false and manipulated stories online. However, a bottleneck for this research is lack of sufficient data to train detection models. We present a novel method for automatically generating Arabic manipulated (and potentially fake) news stories. Our method is simple and only depends on availability of true stories, which are abundant online, and a part of speech tagger (POS). To facilitate future work, we dispense with both of these requirements altogether by providing AraNews, a novel and large POS-tagged news dataset that can be used off-the-shelf. Using stories generated based on AraNews, we carry out a human annotation study that casts light on the effects of machine manipulation on text veracity. The study also measures human ability to detect Arabic machine manipulated text generated by our method. Finally, we develop the first models for detecting manipulated Arabic news and achieve state-of-the-art results on Arabic fake news detection (macro F 1 = 70.06).

226282456,Metrics also Disagree in the Low Scoring Range: Revisiting Summarization Evaluation Metrics,"In text summarization, evaluating the efficacy of automatic metrics without human judgments has become recently popular. One exemplar work (Peyrard, 2019) concludes that automatic metrics strongly disagree when ranking high-scoring summaries. In this paper, we revisit their experiments and find that their observations stem from the fact that metrics disagree in ranking summaries from any narrow scoring range. We hypothesize that this may be because summaries are similar to each other in a narrow scoring range and are thus, difficult to rank. Apart from the width of the scoring range of summaries, we analyze three other properties that impact inter-metric agreement -Ease of Summarization, Abstractiveness, and Coverage. To encourage reproducible research, we make all our analysis code and data publicly available. 1 1 https://github.com/manikbhandari/RevisitSummEvalMetrics 2 Peyrard (2019) uses three experiments to reach their conclusion.

We build a new answerer model based on the LXMERT multimodal transformer and we compare a baseline with and without visual features of the scene. We are interested in studying how the attention mechanisms of LXMERT are used to answer spatial questions since they require putting attention on more than one region simultaneously and spotting the relation holding among them. We show that our proposed model outperforms the baseline by a large extent (9.70% on spatial questions and 6.27% overall). By analyzing LXMERT errors and its attention mechanisms, we find that our classification helps to gain a better understanding of the skills required to answer different spatial questions.",,,
226965200,Hierarchical Transformer for Task Oriented Dialog Systems,"Generative models for dialog systems have gained much interest because of the recent success of RNN and Transformer based models in tasks like question answering and summarization. Although the task of dialog response generation is generally seen as a sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) problem, researchers in the past have found it challenging to train dialog systems using the standard Seq2Seq models. Therefore, to help the model learn meaningful utterance and conversation level features, Sordoni et al. (2015b); Serban et al.(2016)proposed Hierarchical RNN architecture, which was later adopted by several other RNN based dialog systems. With the transformer-based models dominating the seq2seq problems lately, the natural question to ask is the applicability of the notion of hierarchy in transformer based dialog systems. In this paper, we propose a generalized framework for Hierarchical Transformer Encoders and show how a standard transformer can be morphed into any hierarchical encoder, including HRED and HIBERT like models, by using specially designed attention masks and positional encodings. We demonstrate that Hierarchical Encoding helps achieve better natural language understanding of the contexts in transformer-based models for task-oriented dialog systems through a wide range of experiments.

While the prevalence of such language in the general media has long been shown to have harmful effects, it differs from other types of harmful language, in that it is generally used unconsciously and with good intentions. We furthermore believe that the often subtle nature of patronizing and condescending language (PCL) presents an interesting technical challenge for the NLP community.

Despite recent progress on leveraging graph representations to design molecules, such methods are fundamentally limited by the lack of three-dimensional (3D) information. In light of this, we propose a novel actor-critic architecture for 3D molecular design that can generate molecular structures unattainable with previous approaches. This is achieved by exploiting the symmetries of the design process through a rotationally covariant state-action representation based on a spherical harmonics series expansion. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on several 3D molecular design tasks, where we find that building in such symmetries significantly improves generalization and the quality of generated molecules.",,,

One strand of research has used probabilistic regularization for continual learning, with two of the main approaches in this vein being Online Elastic Weight Consolidation (Online EWC) and Variational Continual Learning (VCL). VCL employs variational inference, which in other settings has been improved empirically by applying likelihood-tempering. We show that applying this modification to VCL recovers Online EWC as a limiting case, allowing for interpolation between the two approaches. We term the general algorithm Generalized VCL (GVCL). In order to mitigate the observed overpruning effect of VI, we take inspiration from a common multi-task architecture, neural networks with task-specific FiLM layers, and find that this addition leads to significant performance gains, specifically for variational methods. In the small-data regime, GVCL strongly outperforms existing baselines. In larger datasets, GVCL with FiLM layers outperforms or is competitive with existing baselines in terms of accuracy, whilst also providing significantly better calibration.",,,

228063930,YOU ONLY NEED ADVERSARIAL SUPERVISION FOR SEMANTIC IMAGE SYNTHESIS,"Despite their recent successes, GAN models for semantic image synthesis still suffer from poor image quality when trained with only adversarial supervision. Historically, additionally employing the VGG-based perceptual loss has helped to overcome this issue, significantly improving the synthesis quality, but at the same time limiting the progress of GAN models for semantic image synthesis. In this work, we propose a novel, simplified GAN model, which needs only adversarial supervision to achieve high quality results. We re-design the discriminator as a semantic segmentation network, directly using the given semantic label maps as the ground truth for training. By providing stronger supervision to the discriminator as well as to the generator through spatially-and semantically-aware discriminator feedback, we are able to synthesize images of higher fidelity with better alignment to their input label maps, making the use of the perceptual loss superfluous. Moreover, we enable high-quality multi-modal image synthesis through global and local sampling of a 3D noise tensor injected into the generator, which allows complete or partial image change. We show that images synthesized by our model are more diverse and follow the color and texture distributions of real images more closely. We achieve an average improvement of 6 FID and 5 mIoU points over the state of the art across different datasets using only adversarial supervision.

228372368,INTERACTIVE WEAK SUPERVISION: LEARNING USEFUL HEURISTICS FOR DATA LABELING,"Obtaining large annotated datasets is critical for training successful machine learning models and it is often a bottleneck in practice. Weak supervision offers a promising alternative for producing labeled datasets without ground truth annotations by generating probabilistic labels using multiple noisy heuristics. This process can scale to large datasets and has demonstrated state of the art performance in diverse domains such as healthcare and e-commerce. One practical issue with learning from user-generated heuristics is that their creation requires creativity, foresight, and domain expertise from those who hand-craft them, a process which can be tedious and subjective. We develop the first framework for interactive weak supervision in which a method proposes heuristics and learns from user feedback given on each proposed heuristic. Our experiments demonstrate that only a small number of feedback iterations are needed to train models that achieve highly competitive test set performance without access to ground truth training labels. We conduct user studies, which show that users are able to effectively provide feedback on heuristics and that test set results track the performance of simulated oracles.",,,
228376209,CONVEX POTENTIAL FLOWS: UNIVERSAL PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS WITH OPTIMAL TRANSPORT AND CONVEX OPTIMIZATION,"Flow-based models are powerful tools for designing probabilistic models with tractable density. This paper introduces Convex Potential Flows (CP-Flow), a natural and efficient parameterization of invertible models inspired by the optimal transport (OT) theory. CP-Flows are the gradient map of a strongly convex neural potential function. The convexity implies invertibility and allows us to resort to convex optimization to solve the convex conjugate for efficient inversion. To enable maximum likelihood training, we derive a new gradient estimator of the log-determinant of the Jacobian, which involves solving an inverse-Hessian vector product using the conjugate gradient method. The gradient estimator has constantmemory cost, and can be made effectively unbiased by reducing the error tolerance level of the convex optimization routine. Theoretically, we prove that CP-Flows are universal density approximators and are optimal in the OT sense. Our empirical results show that CP-Flow performs competitively on standard benchmarks of density estimation and variational inference. arXiv:2012.05942v1 [cs.LG] 10 Dec 2020 for generative adversarial networks. arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.05957, 2018. .

229156351,CONTRASTIVE LEARNING WITH ADVERSARIAL PER- TURBATIONS FOR CONDITIONAL TEXT GENERATION,"Recently, sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models with the Transformer architecture have achieved remarkable performance on various conditional text generation tasks, such as machine translation. However, most of them are trained with teacher forcing with the ground truth label given at each time step, without being exposed to incorrectly generated tokens during training, which hurts its generalization to unseen inputs, that is known as the ""exposure bias"" problem. In this work, we propose to mitigate the conditional text generation problem by contrasting positive pairs with negative pairs, such that the model is exposed to various valid or incorrect perturbations of the inputs, for improved generalization. However, training the model with naïve contrastive learning framework using random non-target sequences as negative examples is suboptimal, since they are easily distinguishable from the correct output, especially so with models pretrained with large text corpora. Also, generating positive examples requires domain-specific augmentation heuristics which may not generalize over diverse domains. To tackle this problem, we propose a principled method to generate positive and negative samples for contrastive learning of seq2seq models. Specifically, we generate negative examples by adding small perturbations to the input sequence to minimize its conditional likelihood, and positive examples by adding large perturbations while enforcing it to have a high conditional likelihood. Such ""hard"" positive and negative pairs generated using our method guides the model to better distinguish correct outputs from incorrect ones. We empirically show that our proposed method significantly improves the generalization of the seq2seq on three text Negative Imposter He wasn't in good shape.GT Target SentenceDistant-Target PerturbationHe was was in good shape.PerturbationSource SentenceEncoder-DecoderHe wasn't in great shape <eos> <bos> He wasn't in great shapeSource SentenceEncoder-DecoderHe wasn't in great shape <eos> <bos> He wasn't in great shapeManifold Manifold(a) Teacher ForcingGT Target SentenceSource SentenceEncoder-DecoderHe wasn't in great shape <eos> <bos> He wasn't in great shape Manifold RO: De partea cealaltă, 47% dintre alegătorii republicani afirmă că ar fi ""nemulțumiți"" sau ""supărați"" dacă favoritul Jeb Bush câștigă cursa pentru nominalizare.",,,

We break down any joke into two distinct components: the set-up and the punchline, and further explore the special relationship between them. Inspired by the incongruity theory of humor, we model the setup as the part developing semantic uncertainty, and the punchline disrupting audience expectations. With increasingly powerful language models, we were able to feed the set-up along with the punchline into the GPT-2 language model, and calculate the uncertainty and surprisal values of the jokes. By conducting experiments on the SemEval 2021 Task 7 dataset, we found that these two features have better capabilities of telling jokes from non-jokes, compared with existing baselines.",,,

229680000,The Curse of Dense Low-Dimensional Information Retrieval for Large Index Sizes,"Information Retrieval using dense lowdimensional representations recently became popular and showed out-performance to traditional sparse-representations like BM25. However, no previous work investigated how dense representations perform with large index sizes. We show theoretically and empirically that the performance for dense representations decreases quicker than sparse representations for increasing index sizes. In extreme cases, this can even lead to a tipping point where at a certain index size sparse representations outperform dense representations. We show that this behavior is tightly connected to the number of dimensions of the representations: The lower the dimension, the higher the chance for false positives, i.e. returning irrelevant documents.",,,
229923069,MINILMv2: Multi-Head Self-Attention Relation Distillation for Compressing Pretrained Transformers,"We generalize deep self-attention distillation in MINILM (Wang et al., 2020) by only using self-attention relation distillation for taskagnostic compression of pretrained Transformers. In particular, we define multi-head selfattention relations as scaled dot-product between the pairs of query, key, and value vectors within each self-attention module. Then we employ the above relational knowledge to train the student model. Besides its simplicity and unified principle, more favorably, there is no restriction in terms of the number of student's attention heads, while most previous work has to guarantee the same head number between teacher and student. Moreover, the fine-grained self-attention relations tend to fully exploit the interaction knowledge learned by Transformer. In addition, we thoroughly examine the layer selection strategy for teacher models, rather than just relying on the last layer as in MINILM. We conduct extensive experiments on compressing both monolingual and multilingual pretrained models. Experimental results demonstrate that our models 1 distilled from base-size and large-size teachers (BERT, RoBERTa and XLM-R) outperform the state-of-the-art.",,,
229923538,BinaryBERT: Pushing the Limit of BERT Quantization,"The rapid development of large pre-trained language models has greatly increased the demand for model compression techniques, among which quantization is a popular solution. In this paper, we propose Binary-BERT, which pushes BERT quantization to the limit by weight binarization. We find that a binary BERT is hard to be trained directly than a ternary counterpart due to its complex and irregular loss landscape. Therefore, we propose ternary weight splitting, which initializes BinaryBERT by equivalently splitting from a half-sized ternary network. The binary model thus inherits the good performance of the ternary one, and can be further enhanced by fine-tuning the new architecture after splitting. Empirical results show that our Binary-BERT has only a slight performance drop compared with the full-precision model while being 24× smaller, achieving the state-of-the-art compression results on the GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks.

229923710,Making Pre-trained Language Models Better Few-shot Learners,"The recent GPT-3 model(Brown et al., 2020)achieves remarkable few-shot performance solely by leveraging a natural-language prompt and a few task demonstrations as input context. Inspired by their findings, we study few-shot learning in a more practical scenario, where we use smaller language models for which fine-tuning is computationally efficient. We present LM-BFF-better few-shot fine-tuning of language models 1 -a suite of simple and complementary techniques for finetuning language models on a small number of annotated examples. Our approach includes (1) prompt-based fine-tuning together with a novel pipeline for automating prompt generation; and (2) a refined strategy for dynamically and selectively incorporating demonstrations into each context. Finally, we present a systematic evaluation for analyzing few-shot performance on a range of NLP tasks, including classification and regression. Our experiments demonstrate that our methods combine to dramatically outperform standard fine-tuning procedures in this low resource setting, achieving up to 30% absolute improvement, and 11% on average across all tasks. Our approach makes minimal assumptions on task resources and domain expertise, and hence constitutes a strong task-agnostic method for few-shot learning. 2 * The first two authors contributed equally. 1 Alternatively, language models' best friends forever. 2 Our implementation is publicly available at https:// github.com/princeton-nlp/LM-BFF.

229923720,Transformer Feed-Forward Layers Are Key-Value Memories,"Feed-forward layers constitute two-thirds of a transformer model's parameters, yet their role in the network remains under-explored. We show that feed-forward layers in transformerbased language models operate as key-value memories, where each key correlates with textual patterns in the training examples, and each value induces a distribution over the output vocabulary. Our experiments show that the learned patterns are human-interpretable, and that lower layers tend to capture shallow patterns, while upper layers learn more semantic ones. The values complement the keys' input patterns by inducing output distributions that concentrate probability mass on tokens likely to appear immediately after each pattern, particularly in the upper layers. Finally, we demonstrate that the output of a feed-forward layer is a composition of its memories, which is subsequently refined throughout the model's layers via residual connections to produce the final output distribution.",,,

We propose LayoutLMv2 architecture with new pre-training tasks to model the interaction among text, layout, and image in a single multi-modal framework. Specifically, with a two-stream multi-modal Transformer encoder, LayoutLMv2 uses not only the existing masked visual-language modeling task but also the new text-image alignment and text-image matching tasks, which make it better capture the cross-modality interaction in the pre-training stage. Meanwhile, it also integrates a spatial-aware self-attention mechanism into the Transformer architecture so that the model can fully understand the relative positional relationship among different text blocks. Experiment results show that LayoutLMv2 outperforms LayoutLM by a large margin and achieves new state-ofthe-art results on a wide variety of downstream visually-rich document understanding tasks, including FUNSD (0.7895 → 0.8420), CORD (0.9493 → 0.9601), SROIE (0.9524 → 0.9781), Kleister-NDA (0.8340 → 0.8520), RVL-CDIP (0.9443 → 0.9564), and DocVQA (0.7295 → 0.8672).

229924317,EMERGENT SYMBOLS THROUGH BINDING IN EXTERNAL MEMORY,"A key aspect of human intelligence is the ability to infer abstract rules directly from high-dimensional sensory data, and to do so given only a limited amount of training experience. Deep neural network algorithms have proven to be a powerful tool for learning directly from high-dimensional data, but currently lack this capacity for data-efficient induction of abstract rules, leading some to argue that symbol-processing mechanisms will be necessary to account for this capacity. In this work, we take a step toward bridging this gap by introducing the Emergent Symbol Binding Network (ESBN), a recurrent network augmented with an external memory that enables a form of variable-binding and indirection. This binding mechanism allows symbol-like representations to emerge through the learning process without the need to explicitly incorporate symbol-processing machinery, enabling the ESBN to learn rules in a manner that is abstracted away from the particular entities to which those rules apply. Across a series of tasks, we show that this architecture displays nearly perfect generalization of learned rules to novel entities given only a limited number of training examples, and outperforms a number of other competitive neural network architectures.",,,
229924402,UNIMO: Towards Unified-Modal Understanding and Generation via Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning,"Existed pre-training methods either focus on single-modal tasks or multi-modal tasks, and cannot effectively adapt to each other. They can only utilize single-modal data (i.e., text or image) or limited multi-modal data (i.e., image-text pairs). In this work, we propose a UNIfied-MOdal pre-training architecture, namely UNIMO, which can effectively adapt to both single-modal and multi-modal understanding and generation tasks. Large scale of free text corpus and image collections are utilized to improve the capability of visual and textual understanding, and crossmodal contrastive learning (CMCL) is leveraged to align the textual and visual information into a unified semantic space, over a corpus of image-text pairs augmented with related images and texts. With the help of rich non-paired single-modal data, our model is able to learn more generalizable representations, by allowing textual knowledge and visual knowledge to enhance each other in the unified semantic space. The experimental results show that UNIMO greatly improves the performance of several singlemodal and multi-modal downstream tasks.

230433941,Prefix-Tuning: Optimizing Continuous Prompts for Generation,"Fine-tuning is the de facto way of leveraging large pretrained language models for downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning modifies all the language model parameters and therefore necessitates storing a full copy for each task. In this paper, we propose prefix-tuning, a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for natural language generation tasks, which keeps language model parameters frozen and instead optimizes a sequence of continuous task-specific vectors, which we call the prefix. Prefix-tuning draws inspiration from prompting for language models, allowing subsequent tokens to attend to this prefix as if it were ""virtual tokens"". We apply prefix-tuning to GPT-2 for table-totext generation and to BART for summarization. We show that by modifying only 0.1% of the parameters, prefix-tuning obtains comparable performance in the full data setting, outperforms fine-tuning in low-data settings, and extrapolates better to examples with topics that are unseen during training.Armen Aghajanyan, Luke Zettlemoyer, and Sonal Gupta. 2020.

Exploration of the correlation and causation among the variables in a multivariate time series shows promise in enhancing the performance of a time series model. When using deep neural networks as forecasting models, we hypothesize that exploiting the pairwise information among multiple (multivariate) time series also improves their forecast. If an explicit graph structure is known, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated as powerful tools to exploit the structure. In this work, we propose learning the structure simultaneously with the GNN if the graph is unknown. We cast the problem as learning a probabilistic graph model through optimizing the mean performance over the graph distribution. The distribution is parameterized by a neural network so that discrete graphs can be sampled differentiably through reparameterization. Empirical evaluations show that our method is simpler, more efficient, and better performing than a recently proposed bilevel learning approach for graph structure learning, as well as a broad array of forecasting models, either deep or non-deep learning based, and graph or non-graph based.",,,
231632629,ON DATA-AUGMENTATION AND CONSISTENCY- BASED SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING,"Recently proposed consistency-based Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods such as the Π-model, temporal ensembling, the mean teacher, or the virtual adversarial training, have advanced the state of the art in several SSL tasks. These methods can typically reach performances that are comparable to their fully supervised counterparts while using only a fraction of labelled examples. Despite these methodological advances, the understanding of these methods is still relatively limited. In this text, we analyse (variations of) the Π-model in settings where analytically tractable results can be obtained. We establish links with Manifold Tangent Classifiers and demonstrate that the quality of the perturbations is key to obtaining reasonable SSL performances. Importantly, we propose a simple extension of the Hidden Manifold Model that naturally incorporates data-augmentation schemes and offers a framework for understanding and experimenting with SSL methods.arXiv:2101.06967v1 [stat.ML] 18 Jan 2021Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021Contributions: consistency-based semi-supervised learning methods have recently been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results. Despite these methodological advances, the understanding of these methods is still relatively limited when compared to the fully-supervised setting (Saxe et al.In this article, we do not propose a new SSL method. Instead, we analyse consistency-based methods in settings where analytically tractable results can be obtained, when the data-samples lie in the neighbourhood of well-defined and tractable low-dimensional manifolds, and simple and controlled experiments can be carried out. We establish links with Manifold Tangent Classifiers and demonstrate that consistency-based SSL methods are in general more powerful since they can better exploit the local geometry of the data-manifold if efficient data-augmentation/perturbation schemes are used. Furthermore, in section 4.1 we show that the popular Mean Teacher method and the conceptually more simple Π-model approach share the same solutions in the regime when the data-augmentations are small; this confirms often reported claim that the data-augmentation schemes leveraged by the recent SSL, as well as fully unsupervised algorithms, are instrumental to their success. Finally, in section 4.3 we propose an extension of the Hidden Manifold Model(Goldt et al., 2019;Gerace et al., 2020). This generative model allows us to investigate the properties of consistency-based SSL methods, taking into account the data-augmentation process and the underlying low-dimensionality of the data, in a simple and principled manner, and without relying on a specific dataset. For gaining understanding of SSL, as well as self-supervised learning methods, we believe it to be important to develop a framework that (i) can take into account the geometry of the data (ii) allows the study of the influence of the quality of the data-augmentation schemes (iii) does not rely on any particular dataset. While the understanding of fully-supervised methods have largely been driven by the analysis of simplified model architectures (eg. linear and two-layered models, large dimension asymptotic such as the Neural Tangent Kernel), these analytical tools alone are unlikely to be enough to explain the mechanisms responsible for the success of SSL and self-supervised learning methods Chen et al. (2020); Grill et al. (2020), since they do not, and cannot easily be extended to, account for the geometry of the data and data-augmentation schemes. Our proposed framework offers a small step in that direction.",,,
231632658,What Makes Good In-Context Examples for GPT-3?,"GPT-3 has attracted lots of attention due to its superior performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, especially with its in-context learning abilities. Despite its success, we found that the empirical results of GPT-3 depend heavily on the choice of in-context examples. In this work, we investigate whether there are more effective strategies for judiciously selecting incontext examples (relative to random sampling) that better leverage GPT-3's in-context learning capabilities. Inspired by the recent success of leveraging a retrieval module to augment neural networks, we propose to retrieve examples that are semantically-similar to a test query sample to formulate its corresponding prompt. Intuitively, the examples selected with such a strategy may serve as more informative inputs to unleash GPT-3's power of text generation. We evaluate the proposed approach on several natural language understanding and generation benchmarks, where the retrieval-based prompt selection approach consistently outperforms the random selection baseline. Moreover, it is observed that the sentence encoders finetuned on task-related datasets yield even more helpful retrieval results. Notably, significant gains are observed on tasks such as table-totext generation (44.3% on the ToTTo dataset) and open-domain question answering (45.5% on the NQ dataset).",,,

231648372,Word Alignment by Fine-tuning Embeddings on Parallel Corpora,"Word alignment over parallel corpora has a wide variety of applications, including learning translation lexicons, cross-lingual transfer of language processing tools, and automatic evaluation or analysis of translation outputs. The great majority of past work on word alignment has worked by performing unsupervised learning on parallel text. Recently, however, other work has demonstrated that pre-trained contextualized word embeddings derived from multilingually trained language models (LMs) prove an attractive alternative, achieving competitive results on the word alignment task even in the absence of explicit training on parallel data. In this paper, we examine methods to marry the two approaches: leveraging pre-trained LMs but finetuning them on parallel text with objectives designed to improve alignment quality, and proposing methods to effectively extract alignments from these fine-tuned models. We perform experiments on five language pairs and demonstrate that our model can consistently outperform previous state-of-the-art models of all varieties. In addition, we demonstrate that we are able to train multilingual word aligners that can obtain robust performance on different language pairs.

We show that with small-to-medium training data, applying BitFit on pre-trained BERT models is competitive with (and sometimes better than) fine-tuning the entire model. For larger data, the method is competitive with other sparse fine-tuning methods. Besides their practical utility, these findings are relevant for the question of understanding the commonly-used process of finetuning: they support the hypothesis that finetuning is mainly about exposing knowledge induced by language-modeling training, rather than learning new task-specific linguistic knowledge.",,,
231704318,Zero-shot Neural Passage Retrieval via Domain-targeted Synthetic Question Generation,"A major obstacle to the wide-spread adoption of neural retrieval models is that they require large supervised training sets to surpass traditional term-based techniques, which are constructed from raw corpora. In this paper, we propose an approach to zero-shot learning for passage retrieval that uses synthetic question generation to close this gap. The question generation system is trained on general domain data, but is applied to documents in the targeted domain. This allows us to create arbitrarily large, yet noisy, question-passage relevance pairs that are domain specific. Furthermore, when this is coupled with a simple hybrid termneural model, first-stage retrieval performance can be improved further. Empirically, we show that this is an effective strategy for building neural passage retrieval models in the absence of large training corpora. Depending on the domain, this technique can even approach the accuracy of supervised models.",,,
231740484,META-LEARNING WITH NEGATIVE LEARNING RATES,"Deep learning models require a large amount of data to perform well. When data is scarce for a target task, we can transfer the knowledge gained by training on similar tasks to quickly learn the target. A successful approach is meta-learning, or learning to learn a distribution of tasks, where learning is represented by an outer loop, and to learn by an inner loop of gradient descent. However, a number of recent empirical studies argue that the inner loop is unnecessary and more simple models work equally well or even better. We study the performance of MAML as a function of the learning rate of the inner loop, where zero learning rate implies that there is no inner loop. Using random matrix theory and exact solutions of linear models, we calculate an algebraic expression for the test loss of MAML applied to mixed linear regression and nonlinear regression with overparameterized models. Surprisingly, while the optimal learning rate for adaptation is positive, we find that the optimal learning rate for training is always negative, a setting that has never been considered before. Therefore, not only does the performance increase by decreasing the learning rate to zero, as suggested by recent work, but it can be increased even further by decreasing the learning rate to negative values. These results help clarify under what circumstances meta-learning performs best.arXiv:2102.00940v1 [cs.LG] 1 Feb 2021Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 function of the inner loop learning rate during meta-training. Setting this learning rate to zero is equivalent to removing the inner loop, as advocated by recent work(Chen et al. (2020a), Tian et al. (2020), Dhillon et al. (2020), Chen et al. (2020b, Raghu et al. (2020)). Surprisingly, we find that the optimal learning rate is negative, thus performance can be increased by reducing the learning rate below zero. In particular, we find the following:• In the problem of mixed linear regression, we prove that the optimal learning rate is always negative in overparameterized models. The same result holds in underparameterized models provided that the optimal learning rate is small in absolute value. We validate the theory by running extensive experiments. • We extend these results to the case of nonlinear regression and wide neural networks, in which the output of can be approximated by a linear function of the parameters (Jacot et al.(2018), Lee et al.(2019)). While in this case we cannot prove that the optimal learning rate is always negative, preliminary experiments suggest that the result holds in this case as well.",,,

231749906,GRAPH COARSENING WITH NEURAL NETWORKS,"As large-scale graphs become increasingly more prevalent, it poses significant computational challenges to process, extract and analyze large graph data. Graph coarsening is one popular technique to reduce the size of a graph while maintaining essential properties. Despite rich graph coarsening literature, there is only limited exploration of data-driven methods in the field. In this work, we leverage the recent progress of deep learning on graphs for graph coarsening. We first propose a framework for measuring the quality of coarsening algorithm and show that depending on the goal, we need to carefully choose the Laplace operator on the coarse graph and associated projection/lift operators. Motivated by the observation that the current choice of edge weight for the coarse graph may be suboptimal, we parametrize the weight assignment map with graph neural networks and train it to improve the coarsening quality in an unsupervised way. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real networks, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves common graph coarsening methods under various metrics, reduction ratios, graph sizes, and graph types. It generalizes to graphs of larger size (25× of training graphs), is adaptive to different losses (differentiable and non-differentiable), and scales to much larger graphs than previous work.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 graph. This means the weights of the coarse graph is determined by the coarsening algorithm (of the vertex set), leaving no room for adjustment.With the two observations above, we aim to develop a data-driven approach to better assigning weights for the coarse graph depending on specific goals at hand. We will leverage the recent progress of deep learning on graphs to develop a framework to learn to assign edge weights in an unsupervised manner from a collection of input (small) graphs. This learned weight-assignment map can then be applied to new graphs (of potentially much larger sizes). In particular, our contributions are threefold.• First, depending on the quantity of interest F (such as the quadratic form w.r.t. Laplace operator), one has to carefully choose projection/lift operator to relate quantities defined on graphs of different sizes. We formulate this as the invariance of F under lift map, and provide three cases of projection/lift map as well as the corresponding operators on the coarse graph. Interestingly, those operators all can be seen as the special cases of doubly-weighted Laplace operators on coarse graphs (Horak & Jost, 2013). • Second, we are the first to propose and develop a framework to learn the edge weights of the coarse graphs via graph neural networks (GNN) in an unsupervised manner. We show convincing results both theoretically and empirically that changing the weights is crucial to improve the quality of coarse graphs. • Third, through extensive experiments on both synthetic graphs and real networks, we demonstrate that our method GOREN significantly improves common graph coarsening methods under different evaluation metrics, reduction ratios, graph sizes, and graph types. It generalizes to graphs of larger size (than the training graphs), adapts to different losses (so as to preserve different properties of original graphs), and scales to much larger graphs than what previous work can handle. Even for losses that are not differentiable w.r.t the weights of the coarse graph, we show training networks with a differentiable auxiliary loss still improves the result.",,,
231815627,RocketQA: An Optimized Training Approach to Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering,"In open-domain question answering, dense passage retrieval has become a new paradigm to retrieve relevant passages for finding answers. Typically, the dual-encoder architecture is adopted to learn dense representations of questions and passages for semantic matching. However, it is difficult to effectively train a dual-encoder due to the challenges including the discrepancy between training and inference, the existence of unlabeled positives and limited training data. To address these challenges, we propose an optimized training approach, called RocketQA, to improving dense passage retrieval. We make three major technical contributions in RocketQA, namely crossbatch negatives, denoised hard negatives and data augmentation. The experiment results show that RocketQA significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on both MS-MARCO and Natural Questions. We also conduct extensive experiments to examine the effectiveness of the three strategies in RocketQA. Besides, we demonstrate that the performance of end-to-end QA can be improved based on our RocketQA retriever 1 .",,,
231847109,OPEN-WORLD SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING,"A fundamental limitation of applying semi-supervised learning in real-world settings is the assumption that unlabeled test data contains only classes previously encountered in the labeled training data. However, this assumption rarely holds for data in-the-wild, where instances belonging to novel classes may appear at testing time. Here, we introduce a novel open-world semi-supervised learning setting that formalizes the notion that novel classes may appear in the unlabeled test data. In this novel setting, the goal is to solve the class distribution mismatch between labeled and unlabeled data, where at the test time every input instance either needs to be classified into one of the existing classes or a new unseen class needs to be initialized. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose ORCA, an end-to-end deep learning approach that introduces uncertainty adaptive margin mechanism to circumvent the bias towards seen classes caused by learning discriminative features for seen classes faster than for the novel classes. In this way, ORCA reduces the gap between intra-class variance of seen with respect to novel classes. Experiments on image classification datasets and a single-cell annotation dataset demonstrate that ORCA consistently outperforms alternative baselines, achieving 25% improvement on seen and 96% improvement on novel classes of the ImageNet dataset. * The two first authors made equal contributions.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 Stuart Lloyd.

231847288,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 ADVERSARIALLY GUIDED ACTOR-CRITIC,"Despite definite success in deep reinforcement learning problems, actor-critic algorithms are still confronted with sample inefficiency in complex environments, particularly in tasks where efficient exploration is a bottleneck. These methods consider a policy (the actor) and a value function (the critic) whose respective losses are built using different motivations and approaches. This paper introduces a third protagonist: the adversary. While the adversary mimics the actor by minimizing the KL-divergence between their respective action distributions, the actor, in addition to learning to solve the task, tries to differentiate itself from the adversary predictions. This novel objective stimulates the actor to follow strategies that could not have been correctly predicted from previous trajectories, making its behavior innovative in tasks where the reward is extremely rare. Our experimental analysis shows that the resulting Adversarially Guided Actor-Critic (AGAC) algorithm leads to more exhaustive exploration. Notably, AGAC outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on a set of various hard-exploration and procedurally-generated tasks. * Equal contribution.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 This paper analyses and explores how AGAC explicitly drives diversity in the behaviors of the agent while remaining reward-focused, and to which extent this approach allows to adapt to the evolving state space of procedurally-generated environments where the map is constructed differently with each new episode. Moreover, because stability is a legitimate concern since specific instances of adversarial networks were shown to be prone to hyperparameter sensitivity issues(Arjovsky & Bottou, 2017), we also examine this aspect in our experiments.The contributions of this work are as follow: (i) we propose a novel actor-critic formulation inspired from adversarial learning (AGAC), (ii) we analyse empirically AGAC on key reinforcement learning aspects such as diversity, exploration and stability, (iii) we demonstrate significant gains in performance on several sparse-reward hard-exploration tasks including procedurally-generated tasks.",,,

However, it is unclear whether these priors accurately reflect our true beliefs about the weight distributions or give optimal performance. To find better priors, we study summary statistics of neural network weights in networks trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We find that convolutional neural network (CNN) and ResNet weights display strong spatial correlations, while fully connected networks (FCNNs) display heavy-tailed weight distributions.

Unfortunately current methods generally do not scale well beyond the small tabular setting due to the need for an inner-loop MDP solver, and even non-Bayesian methods that do themselves scale often require extensive interaction with the environment to perform well, being inappropriate for high stakes or costly applications such as healthcare. In this paper we introduce our method, Approximate Variational Reward Imitation Learning (AVRIL), that addresses both of these issues by jointly learning an approximate posterior distribution over the reward that scales to arbitrarily complicated state spaces alongside an appropriate policy in a completely offline manner through a variational approach to said latent reward.

We present TOGL, a novel layer that incorporates global topological information of a graph using persistent homology. TOGL can be easily integrated into any type of GNN and is strictly more expressive (in terms the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test) than message-passing GNNs. Augmenting GNNs with TOGL leads to improved predictive performance for graph and node classification tasks, both on synthetic data sets, which can be classified by humans using their topology but not by ordinary GNNs, and on real-world data.",,,
231951460,Entity-level Factual Consistency of Abstractive Text Summarization,"A key challenge for abstractive summarization is ensuring factual consistency of the generated summary with respect to the original document. For example, state-of-the-art models trained on existing datasets exhibit entity hallucination, generating names of entities that are not present in the source document. We propose a set of new metrics to quantify the entity-level factual consistency of generated summaries and we show that the entity hallucination problem can be alleviated by simply filtering the training data. In addition, we propose a summary-worthy entity classification task to the training process as well as a joint entity and summary generation approach, which yield further improvements in entity level metrics.",,,
231967791,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 LEARNING NEURAL GENERATIVE DYNAMICS FOR MOLECULAR CONFORMATION GENERATION,"We study how to generate molecule conformations (i.e., 3D structures) from a molecular graph. Traditional methods, such as molecular dynamics, sample conformations via computationally expensive simulations. Recently, machine learning methods have shown great potential by training on a large collection of conformation data. Challenges arise from the limited model capacity for capturing complex distributions of conformations and the difficulty in modeling long-range dependencies between atoms. Inspired by the recent progress in deep generative models, in this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic framework to generate valid and diverse conformations given a molecular graph. We propose a method combining the advantages of both flow-based and energy-based models, enjoying:(1) a high model capacity to estimate the multimodal conformation distribution;(2) explicitly capturing the complex long-range dependencies between atoms in the observation space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method on several benchmarks, including conformation generation and distance modeling tasks, with a significant improvement over existing generative models for molecular conformation sampling.",,,
232046055,TASK-AGNOSTIC MORPHOLOGY EVOLUTION,"Deep reinforcement learning primarily focuses on learning behavior, usually overlooking the fact that an agent's function is largely determined by form. So, how should one go about finding a morphology fit for solving tasks in a given environment? Current approaches that co-adapt morphology and behavior use a specific task's reward as a signal for morphology optimization. However, this often requires expensive policy optimization and results in task-dependent morphologies that are not built to generalize. In this work, we propose a new approach, Task-Agnostic Morphology Evolution (TAME), to alleviate both of these issues. Without any task or reward specification, TAME evolves morphologies by only applying randomly sampled action primitives on a population of agents. This is accomplished using an information-theoretic objective that efficiently ranks agents by their ability to reach diverse states in the environment and the causality of their actions. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that across 2D, 3D, and manipulation environments TAME can evolve morphologies that match the multi-task performance of those learned with task supervised algorithms.

232075836,Long Document Summarization in a Low Resource Setting using Pretrained Language Models,"Abstractive summarization is the task of compressing a long document into a coherent short document while retaining salient information. Modern abstractive summarization methods are based on deep neural networks which often require large training datasets. Since collecting summarization datasets is an expensive and time-consuming task, practical industrial settings are usually low-resource. In this paper, we study a challenging low-resource setting of summarizing long legal briefs with an average source document length of 4268 words and only 120 available (document, summary) pairs. To account for data scarcity, we used a modern pretrained abstractive summarizer BART (Lewis et al., 2020), which only achieves 17.9 ROUGE-L as it struggles with long documents. We thus attempt to compress these long documents by identifying salient sentences in the source which best ground the summary, using a novel algorithm based on GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) language model perplexity scores, that operates within the low resource regime. On feeding the compressed documents to BART, we observe a 6.0 ROUGE-L improvement. Our method also beats several competitive salience detection baselines. Furthermore, the identified salient sentences tend to agree with an independent human labeling by domain experts. *",,,
232092291,COORDINATION AMONG NEURAL MODULES THROUGH A SHARED GLOBAL WORKSPACE,"Deep learning has seen a movement away from representing examples with a monolithic hidden state towards a richly structured state. For example, Transformers segment by position, and object-centric architectures decompose images into entities. In all these architectures, interactions between different elements are modeled via pairwise interactions: Transformers make use of self-attention to incorporate information from other positions and object-centric architectures make use of graph neural networks to model interactions among entities. We consider how to improve on pairwise interactions in terms of global coordination and a coherent, integrated representation that can be used for downstream tasks. In cognitive science, a global workspace architecture has been proposed in which functionally specialized components share information through a common, bandwidth-limited communication channel. We explore the use of such a communication channel in the context of deep learning for modeling the structure of complex environments. The proposed method includes a shared workspace through which communication among different specialist modules takes place but due to limits on the communication bandwidth, specialist modules must compete for access. We show that capacity limitations have a rational basis in that (1) they encourage specialization and compositionality and (2) they facilitate the synchronization of otherwise independent specialists.",,,

We investigate in this paper if this manifests also in online communication of the supporters of the candidates Biden and Trump, by uttering hateful and offensive communication. We formulate an annotation task, in which we join the tasks of hateful/offensive speech detection and stance detection, and annotate 3000 Tweets from the campaign period, if they express a particular stance towards a candidate. Next to the established classes of favorable and against, we add mixed and neutral stances and also annotate if a candidate is mentioned without an opinion expression. Further, we annotate if the tweet is written in an offensive style. This enables us to analyze if supporters of Joe Biden and the Democratic Party communicate differently than supporters of Donald Trump and the Republican Party. A BERT baseline classifier shows that the detection if somebody is a supporter of a candidate can be performed with high quality (.89 F 1 for Trump and .91 F 1 for Biden), while the detection that somebody expresses to be against a candidate is more challenging (.79 F 1 and .64 F 1 , respectively). The automatic detection of hate/offensive speech remains challenging (with .53 F 1 ). Our corpus is publicly available and constitutes a novel resource for computational modelling of offensive language under consideration of stances.",,,
232104941,Data Augmentation with Hierarchical SQL-to-Question Generation for Cross-domain Text-to-SQL Parsing,"Data augmentation has attracted a lot of research attention in the deep learning era for its ability in alleviating data sparseness. The lack of labeled data for unseen evaluation databases is exactly the major challenge for cross-domain text-to-SQL parsing. Previous works either require human intervention to guarantee the quality of generated data, or fail to handle complex SQL queries. This paper presents a simple yet effective data augmentation framework. First, given a database, we automatically produce a large number of SQL queries based on an abstract syntax tree grammar. For better distribution matching, we require that at least 80% of SQL patterns in the training data are covered by generated queries. Second, we propose a hierarchical SQL-to-question generation model to obtain high-quality natural language questions, which is the major contribution of this work. Finally, we design a simple sampling strategy that can greatly improve training efficiency given large amounts of generated data. Experiments on three cross-domain datasets, i.e., WikiSQL and Spider in English, and DuSQL in Chinese, show that our proposed data augmentation framework can consistently improve performance over strong baselines, and the hierarchical generation component is the key for the improvement.",,,
232135120,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 IOT: INSTANCE-WISE LAYER REORDERING FOR TRANSFORMER STRUCTURES,"With sequentially stacked self-attention, (optional) encoder-decoder attention, and feed-forward layers, Transformer achieves big success in natural language processing (NLP), and many variants have been proposed. Currently, almost all these models assume that the layer order is fixed and kept the same across data samples. We observe that different data samples actually favor different orders of the layers. Based on this observation, in this work, we break the assumption of the fixed layer order in Transformer and introduce instance-wise layer reordering into model structure. Our Instance-wise Ordered Transformer (IOT) can model variant functions by reordered layers, which enables each sample to select the better one to improve the model performance under the constraint of almost same number of parameters. To achieve this, we introduce a light predictor with negligible parameter and inference cost to decide the most capable and favorable layer order for any input sequence. Experiments on 3 tasks (neural machine translation, abstractive summarization, and code generation) and 9 datasets demonstrate consistent improvements of our method. We further show that our method can also be applied to other architectures beyond Transformer.

232185112,CANINE: Pre-training an Efficient Tokenization-Free Encoder for Language Representation,"Pipelined NLP systems have largely been superseded by end-to-end neural modeling, yet nearly all commonly used models still require an explicit tokenization step. While recent tokenization approaches based on data-derived subword lexicons are less brittle than manually engineered tokenizers, these techniques are not equally suited to all languages, and the use of any fixed vocabulary may limit a model's ability to adapt. In this paper, we present CANINE, a neural encoder that operates directly on character sequences-without explicit tokenization or vocabulary-and a pre-training strategy that operates either directly on characters or optionally uses subwords as a soft inductive bias. To use its finer-grained input effectively and efficiently, CANINE combines downsampling, which reduces the input sequence length, with a deep transformer stack, which encodes context. CANINE outperforms a comparable mBERT model by 5.7 F1 on TYDI QA, a challenging multilingual benchmark, despite having fewer model parameters.73",,,

Compared with existing public corpora for dialogue summarization, our dataset is an order of magnitude larger and contains complex multi-party conversations from multiple domains. We conduct statistical analysis to demonstrate the unique positional bias exhibited in the transcripts of televised and radioed interviews.

232233194,Multi-view Subword Regularization,"Multilingual pretrained representations generally rely on subword segmentation algorithms to create a shared multilingual vocabulary. However, standard heuristic algorithms often lead to sub-optimal segmentation, especially for languages with limited amounts of data. In this paper, we take two major steps towards alleviating this problem. First, we demonstrate empirically that applying existing subword regularization methods(Kudo, 2018;Provilkov et al., 2020)during fine-tuning of pre-trained multilingual representations improves the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer. Second, to take full advantage of different possible input segmentations, we propose Multi-view Subword Regularization (MVR), a method that enforces the consistency between predictions of using inputs tokenized by the standard and probabilistic segmentations. Results on the XTREME multilingual benchmark  show that MVR brings consistent improvements of up to 2.5 points over using standard segmentation algorithms. 1",,,
232233677,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 IMPROVING ADVERSARIAL ROBUSTNESS VIA CHANNEL-WISE ACTIVATION SUPPRESSING,"The study of adversarial examples and their activation has attracted significant attention for secure and robust learning with deep neural networks (DNNs). Different from existing works, in this paper, we highlight two new characteristics of adversarial examples from the channel-wise activation perspective: 1) the activation magnitudes of adversarial examples are higher than that of natural examples; and 2) the channels are activated more uniformly by adversarial examples than natural examples. We find that the state-of-the-art defense adversarial training has addressed the first issue of high activation magnitudes via training on adversarial examples, while the second issue of uniform activation remains. This motivates us to suppress redundant activation from being activated by adversarial perturbations via a Channel-wise Activation Suppressing (CAS) strategy. We show that CAS can train a model that inherently suppresses adversarial activation, and can be easily applied to existing defense methods to further improve their robustness. Our work provides a simple but generic training strategy for robustifying the intermediate layer activation of DNNs. Code is available at",,,

In practice, training on the meta-training set may not always be an option due to data privacy concerns, intellectual property issues, or merely lack of computing resources. In this paper, we consider the novel problem of repurposing pretrained MAML checkpoints to solve new few-shot classification tasks. Because of the potential distribution mismatch, the original MAML steps may no longer be optimal. Therefore we propose an alternative meta-testing procedure and combine MAML gradient steps with adversarial training and uncertainty-based stepsize adaptation. Our method outperforms ""vanilla"" MAML on same-domain and cross-domains benchmarks using both SGD and Adam optimizers and shows improved robustness to the choice of base stepsize. * Work done as visiting researchers at SAIT AI Lab, Montreal. † Canada CIFAR AI Chair Luo.

232257725,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 GRADIENT PROJECTION MEMORY FOR CONTINUAL LEARNING,"The ability to learn continually without forgetting the past tasks is a desired attribute for artificial learning systems. Existing approaches to enable such learning in artificial neural networks usually rely on network growth, importance based weight update or replay of old data from the memory. In contrast, we propose a novel approach where a neural network learns new tasks by taking gradient steps in the orthogonal direction to the gradient subspaces deemed important for the past tasks. We find the bases of these subspaces by analyzing network representations (activations) after learning each task with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in a single shot manner and store them in the memory as Gradient Projection Memory (GPM). With qualitative and quantitative analyses, we show that such orthogonal gradient descent induces minimum to no interference with the past tasks, thereby mitigates forgetting. We evaluate our algorithm on diverse image classification datasets with short and long sequences of tasks and report better or on-par performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches 1 . 1 Our code is available at https",,,
232257793,HYPERDYNAMICS: META-LEARNING OBJECT AND AGENT DYNAMICS WITH HYPERNETWORKS,"We propose HyperDynamics, a dynamics meta-learning framework that conditions on an agent's interactions with the environment and optionally its visual observations, and generates the parameters of neural dynamics models based on inferred properties of the dynamical system. Physical and visual properties of the environment that are not part of the low-dimensional state yet affect its temporal dynamics are inferred from the interaction history and visual observations, and are implicitly captured in the generated parameters. We test HyperDynamics on a set of object pushing and locomotion tasks. It outperforms existing dynamics models in the literature that adapt to environment variations by learning dynamics over high dimensional visual observations, capturing the interactions of the agent in recurrent state representations, or using gradient-based meta-optimization. We also show our method matches the performance of an ensemble of separately trained experts, while also being able to generalize well to unseen environment variations at test time. We attribute its good performance to the multiplicative interactions between the inferred system properties-captured in the generated parametersand the low-dimensional state representation of the dynamical system.",,,
232257874,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 TRAINING GANS WITH STRONGER AUGMENTATIONS VIA CONTRASTIVE DISCRIMINATOR,"Recent works in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are actively revisiting various data augmentation techniques as an effective way to prevent discriminator overfitting. It is still unclear, however, that which augmentations could actually improve GANs, and in particular, how to apply a wider range of augmentations in training. In this paper, we propose a novel way to address these questions by incorporating a recent contrastive representation learning scheme into the GAN discriminator, coined ContraD. This ""fusion"" enables the discriminators to work with much stronger augmentations without increasing their training instability, thereby preventing the discriminator overfitting issue in GANs more effectively. Even better, we observe that the contrastive learning itself also benefits from our GAN training, i.e., by maintaining discriminative features between real and fake samples, suggesting a strong coherence between the two worlds: good contrastive representations are also good for GAN discriminators, and vice versa. Our experimental results show that GANs with ContraD consistently improve FID and IS compared to other recent techniques incorporating data augmentations, still maintaining highly discriminative features in the discriminator in terms of the linear evaluation. Finally, as a byproduct, we also show that our GANs trained in an unsupervised manner (without labels) can induce many conditional generative models via a simple latent sampling, leveraging the learned features of ContraD.

232258000,Towards Few-Shot Fact-Checking via Perplexity,"Few-shot learning has drawn researchers' attention to overcome the problem of data scarcity. Recently, large pre-trained language models have shown great performance in fewshot learning for various downstream tasks, such as question answering and machine translation. Nevertheless, little exploration has been made to achieve few-shot learning for the fact-checking task. However, fact-checking is an important problem, especially when the amount of information online is growing exponentially every day. In this paper, we propose a new way of utilizing the powerful transfer learning ability of a language model via a perplexity score. The most notable strength of our methodology lies in its capability in fewshot learning. With only two training samples, our methodology can already outperform the Major Class baseline by more than an absolute 10% on the F1-Macro metric across multiple datasets. Through experiments, we empirically verify the plausibility of the rather surprising usage of the perplexity score in the context of fact-checking and highlight the strength of our few-shot methodology by comparing it to strong fine-tuning-based baseline models. Moreover, we construct and publicly release two new fact-checking datasets related to",,,
232269984,LARGE SCALE IMAGE COMPLETION VIA CO-MODUL- ATED GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS,"Numerous task-specific variants of conditional generative adversarial networks have been developed for image completion. Yet, a serious limitation remains that all existing algorithms tend to fail when handling large-scale missing regions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a generic new approach that bridges the gap between image-conditional and recent modulated unconditional generative architectures via co-modulation of both conditional and stochastic style representations. Also, due to the lack of good quantitative metrics for image completion, we propose the new Paired/Unpaired Inception Discriminative Score (P-IDS/U-IDS), which robustly measures the perceptual fidelity of inpainted images compared to real images via linear separability in a feature space. Experiments demonstrate superior performance in terms of both quality and diversity over state-of-the-art methods in free-form image completion and easy generalization to image-to-image translation.

232307112,SSD: A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK FOR SELF- SUPERVISED OUTLIER DETECTION,"We ask the following question: what training information is required to design an effective outlier/out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, i.e., detecting samples that lie far away from the training distribution? Since unlabeled data is easily accessible for many applications, the most compelling approach is to develop detectors based on only unlabeled in-distribution data. However, we observe that most existing detectors based on unlabeled data perform poorly, often equivalent to a random prediction. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art OOD detectors achieve impressive performance but require access to fine-grained data labels for supervised training. We propose SSD, an outlier detector based on only unlabeled in-distribution data. We use self-supervised representation learning followed by a Mahalanobis distance based detection in the feature space. We demonstrate that SSD outperforms most existing detectors based on unlabeled data by a large margin. Additionally, SSD even achieves performance on par, and sometimes even better, with supervised training based detectors. Finally, we expand our detection framework with two key extensions. First, we formulate few-shot OOD detection, in which the detector has access to only one to five samples from each class of the targeted OOD dataset. Second, we extend our framework to incorporate training data labels, if available. We find that our novel detection framework based on SSD displays enhanced performance with these extensions, and achieves state-of-the-art performance 1 .",,,
232307359,LANGUAGE-AGNOSTIC REPRESENTATION LEARNING OF SOURCE CODE FROM STRUCTURE AND CONTEXT,"Source code (Context) and its parsed abstract syntax tree (AST; Structure) are two complementary representations of the same computer program. Traditionally, designers of machine learning models have relied predominantly either on Structure or Context. We propose a new model, which jointly learns on Context and Structure of source code. In contrast to previous approaches, our model uses only language-agnostic features, i.e., source code and features that can be computed directly from the AST. Besides obtaining state-of-the-art on monolingual code summarization on all five programming languages considered in this work, we propose the first multilingual code summarization model. We show that jointly training on non-parallel data from multiple programming languages improves results on all individual languages, where the strongest gains are on low-resource languages. Remarkably, multilingual training only from Context does not lead to the same improvements, highlighting the benefits of combining Structure and Context for representation learning on code.",,,

MODULAR VERSUS MONOLITHIC TASK FORMULATIONS IN NEURAL NETWORKS,"Can deep learning solve multiple tasks simultaneously, even when they are unrelated and very different? We investigate how the representations of the underlying tasks affect the ability of a single neural network to learn them jointly. We present theoretical and empirical findings that a single neural network is capable of simultaneously learning multiple tasks from a combined data set, for a variety of methods for representing tasks-for example, when the distinct tasks are encoded by well-separated clusters or decision trees over certain task-code attributes. More concretely, we present a novel analysis that shows that families of simple programming-like constructs for the codes encoding the tasks are learnable by two-layer neural networks with standard training. We study more generally how the complexity of learning such combined tasks grows with the complexity of the task codes; we find that combining many tasks may incur a sample complexity penalty, even though the individual tasks are easy to learn.

We propose a more advanced fine-tuning strategy and a learning-toexit module that extends early exiting to tasks other than classification. Experiments demonstrate improved early exiting for BERT, with better trade-offs obtained by the proposed finetuning strategy, successful application to regression tasks, and the possibility to combine it with other acceleration methods.

Contextualizing the buildup of such ideation is critical for the identification of users at risk. In this work, we focus on identifying suicidal intent in tweets by augmenting linguistic models with emotional phases modeled from users' historical context. We propose PHASE, a time-and phase-aware framework that adaptively learns features from a user's historical emotional spectrum on Twitter for preliminary screening of suicidal risk. Building on clinical studies, PHASE learns phase-like progressions in users' historical Plutchik-wheel-based emotions to contextualize suicidal intent. While outperforming stateof-the-art methods, we show the utility of temporal and phase-based emotional contextual cues for suicide ideation detection.

233209848,Does syntax matter? A strong baseline for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis with RoBERTa,"Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), aiming at predicting the polarities for aspects, is a fine-grained task in the field of sentiment analysis. Previous work showed syntactic information, e.g. dependency trees, can effectively improve the ABSA performance. Recently, pre-trained models (PTMs) also have shown their effectiveness on ABSA. Therefore, the question naturally arises whether PTMs contain sufficient syntactic information for ABSA so that we can obtain a good ABSA model only based on PTMs. In this paper, we firstly compare the induced trees from PTMs and the dependency parsing trees on several popular models for the ABSA task, showing that the induced tree from finetuned RoBERTa (FT-RoBERTa) outperforms the parser-provided tree. The further analysis experiments reveal that the FT-RoBERTa Induced Tree is more sentiment-word-oriented and could benefit the ABSA task. The experiments also show that the pure RoBERTa-based model can outperform or approximate to the previous SOTA performances on six datasets across four languages since it implicitly incorporates the task-oriented syntactic information.",,,
233210172,ShadowGNN: Graph Projection Neural Network for Text-to-SQL Parser,"Given a database schema, Text-to-SQL aims to translate a natural language question into the corresponding SQL query. Under the setup of cross-domain, traditional semantic parsing models struggle to adapt to unseen database schemas. To improve the model generalization capability for rare and unseen schemas, we propose a new architecture, ShadowGNN, which processes schemas at abstract and semantic levels. By ignoring names of semantic items in databases, abstract schemas are exploited in a well-designed graph projection neural network to obtain delexicalized representation of question and schema. Based on the domain-independent representations, a relation-aware transformer is utilized to further extract logical linking between question and schema. Finally, a SQL decoder with context-free grammar is applied. On the challenging Text-to-SQL benchmark Spider, empirical results show that ShadowGNN outperforms state-of-the-art models. When the annotated data is extremely limited (only 10% training set), ShadowGNN gets over absolute 5% performance gain, which shows its powerful generalization ability.

233210199,Factual Probing Is [MASK]: Learning vs. Learning to Recall,"Petroni et al. (2019)demonstrated that it is possible to retrieve world facts from a pretrained language model by expressing them as cloze-style prompts and interpret the model's prediction accuracy as a lower bound on the amount of factual information it encodes. Subsequent work has attempted to tighten the estimate by searching for better prompts, using a disjoint set of facts as training data. In this work, we make two complementary contributions to better understand these factual probing techniques. First, we propose OPTIPROMPT, a novel and efficient method which directly optimizes in continuous embedding space. We find this simple method is able to predict an additional 6.4% of facts in the LAMA benchmark. Second, we raise a more important question: Can we really interpret these probing results as a lower bound? Is it possible that these prompt-search methods learn from the training data too? We find, somewhat surprisingly, that the training data used by these methods contains certain regularities of the underlying fact distribution, and all the existing prompt methods, including ours, are able to exploit them for better fact prediction. We conduct a set of control experiments to disentangle ""learning"" from ""learning to recall"", providing a more detailed picture of what different prompts can reveal about pre-trained language models. 1",,,
233210621,Probabilistic Box Embeddings for Uncertain Knowledge Graph Reasoning,"Knowledge bases often consist of facts which are harvested from a variety of sources, many of which are noisy and some of which conflict, resulting in a level of uncertainty for each triple. Knowledge bases are also often incomplete, prompting the use of embedding methods to generalize from known facts, however existing embedding methods only model triple-level uncertainty and reasoning results lack global consistency. To address these shortcomings, we propose BEUrRE , a novel uncertain knowledge graph embedding method with calibrated probabilistic semantics. BEUrRE models each entity as a box (i.e. axis-aligned hyperrectangle), and relations between two entities as affine transforms on the head and tail entity boxes. The geometry of the boxes allows for efficient calculation of intersections and volumes, endowing the model with calibrated probabilistic semantics and facilitating the incorporation of relational constraints. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that BEUrRE consistently outperforms baselines on confidence prediction and fact ranking due to it's probabilistic calibration and ability to capture high-order dependencies among facts.",,,
233210761,Multilingual Language Models Predict Human Reading Behavior,"We analyze if large language models are able to predict patterns of human reading behavior. We compare the performance of language-specific and multilingual pretrained transformer models to predict reading time measures reflecting natural human sentence processing on Dutch, English, German, and Russian texts. This results in accurate models of human reading behavior, which indicates that transformer models implicitly encode relative importance in language in a way that is comparable to human processing mechanisms. We find that BERT and XLM models successfully predict a range of eye tracking features. In a series of experiments, we analyze the cross-domain and cross-language abilities of these models and show how they reflect human sentence processing.",,,
233219059,QuestEval: Summarization Asks for Fact-based Evaluation,"Summarization evaluation remains an open research problem: current metrics such as ROUGE are known to be limited and to correlate poorly with human judgments. To alleviate this issue, recent work has proposed evaluation metrics which rely on question answering models to assess whether a summary contains all the relevant information in its source document. Though promising, the proposed approaches have so far failed to correlate better than ROUGE with human judgments.In this paper, we extend previous approaches and propose a unified framework, named QuestEval.In contrast to established metrics such as ROUGE or BERTScore, QuestEval does not require any groundtruth reference. Nonetheless, QuestEval substantially improves the correlation with human judgments over four evaluation dimensions (consistency, coherence, fluency, and relevance), as shown in the extensive experiments we report.",,,
233219699,Does My Representation Capture X? Probe-Ably,"Probing (or diagnostic classification) has become a popular strategy for investigating whether a given set of intermediate features is present in the representations of neural models. Probing studies may have misleading results, but various recent works have suggested more reliable methodologies that compensate for the possible pitfalls of probing. However, these best practices are numerous and fast-evolving. To simplify the process of running a set of probing experiments in line with suggested methodologies, we introduce Probe-Ably: an extendable probing framework which supports and automates the application of probing methods to the user's inputs.",,,
233230124,Concealed Data Poisoning Attacks on NLP Models,"Adversarial attacks alter NLP model predictions by perturbing test-time inputs. However, it is much less understood whether, and how, predictions can be manipulated with small, concealed changes to the training data. In this work, we develop a new data poisoning attack that allows an adversary to control model predictions whenever a desired trigger phrase is present in the input. For instance, we insert 50 poison examples into a sentiment model's training set that causes the model to frequently predict Positive whenever the input contains ""James Bond"". Crucially, we craft these poison examples using a gradient-based procedure so that they do not mention the trigger phrase. We also apply our poison attack to language modeling (""Apple iPhone"" triggers negative generations) and machine translation (""iced coffee"" mistranslated as ""hot coffee""). We conclude by proposing three defenses that can mitigate our attack at some cost in prediction accuracy or extra human annotation.",,,
233231453,Learning How to Ask: Querying LMs with Mixtures of Soft Prompts,"Natural-language prompts have recently been used to coax pretrained language models into performing other AI tasks, using a fill-in-theblank paradigm (Petroni et al., 2019) or a few-shot extrapolation paradigm (Brown et al.,  2020). For example, language models retain factual knowledge from their training corpora that can be extracted by asking them to ""fill in the blank"" in a sentential prompt. However, where does this prompt come from? We explore the idea of learning prompts by gradient descent-either fine-tuning prompts taken from previous work, or starting from random initialization. Our prompts consist of ""soft words,"" i.e., continuous vectors that are not necessarily word type embeddings from the language model. Furthermore, for each task, we optimize a mixture of prompts, learning which prompts are most effective and how to ensemble them. Across multiple English LMs and tasks, our approach hugely outperforms previous methods, showing that the implicit factual knowledge in language models was previously underestimated. Moreover, this knowledge is cheap to elicit: random initialization is nearly as good as informed initialization.",,,
233231544,IGA: An Intent-Guided Authoring Assistant,"While large-scale pretrained language models have significantly improved writing assistance functionalities such as autocomplete, more complex and controllable writing assistants have yet to be explored. We leverage advances in language modeling to build an interactive writing assistant that generates and rephrases text according to fine-grained author specifications. Users provide input to our Intent-Guided Assistant (IGA) in the form of text interspersed with tags that correspond to specific rhetorical directives (e.g., adding description or contrast, or rephrasing a particular sentence). We fine-tune a language model on a dataset heuristically-labeled with author intent, which allows IGA to fill in these tags with generated text that users can subsequently edit to their liking. A series of automatic and crowdsourced evaluations confirm the quality of IGA's generated outputs, while a smallscale user study demonstrates author preference for IGA over baseline methods in a creative writing task. We release our dataset, code, and demo to spur further research into AI-assisted writing.",,,
233289483,Q 2 : Evaluating Factual Consistency in Knowledge-Grounded Dialogues via Question Generation and Question Answering,"Neural knowledge-grounded generative models for dialogue often produce content that is factually inconsistent with the knowledge they rely on, making them unreliable and limiting their applicability. Inspired by recent work on evaluating factual consistency in abstractive summarization, we propose an automatic evaluation metric for factual consistency in knowledge-grounded dialogue using automatic question generation and question answering. Our metric, denoted Q 2 , compares answer spans using natural language inference (NLI), instead of token-based matching as done in previous work. To foster proper evaluation, we curate a novel dataset of dialogue system outputs for the Wizard-of-Wikipedia dataset, manually annotated for factual consistency. We perform a thorough meta-evaluation of Q 2 against other metrics using this dataset and two others, where it consistently shows higher correlation with human judgements.",,,
233289620,"Fast, Effective, and Self-Supervised: Transforming Masked Language Models into Universal Lexical and Sentence Encoders","Previous work has indicated that pretrained Masked Language Models (MLMs) are not effective as universal lexical and sentence encoders off-the-shelf, i.e., without further taskspecific fine-tuning on NLI, sentence similarity, or paraphrasing tasks using annotated task data. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to turn MLMs into effective lexical and sentence encoders even without any additional data, relying simply on self-supervision. We propose an extremely simple, fast, and effective contrastive learning technique, termed Mirror-BERT, which converts MLMs (e.g., BERT and RoBERTa) into such encoders in 20-30 seconds with no access to additional external knowledge. Mirror-BERT relies on identical and slightly modified string pairs as positive (i.e., synonymous) fine-tuning examples, and aims to maximise their similarity during ""identity fine-tuning"". We report huge gains over off-the-shelf MLMs with Mirror-BERT both in lexical-level and in sentencelevel tasks, across different domains and different languages. Notably, in sentence similarity (STS) and question-answer entailment (QNLI) tasks, our self-supervised Mirror-BERT model even matches the performance of the Sentence-BERT models from prior work which rely on annotated task data. Finally, we delve deeper into the inner workings of MLMs, and suggest some evidence on why this simple Mirror-BERT fine-tuning approach can yield effective universal lexical and sentence encoders.",,,
233296059,Neural Path Hunter: Reducing Hallucination in Dialogue Systems via Path Grounding,"Dialogue systems powered by large pretrained language models exhibit an innate ability to deliver fluent and natural-sounding responses. Despite their impressive performance, these models are fitful and can often generate factually incorrect statements impeding their widespread adoption. In this paper, we focus on the task of improving faithfulness and reducing hallucination of neural dialogue systems to known facts supplied by a Knowledge Graph (KG). We propose NEU-RAL PATH HUNTER which follows a generatethen-refine strategy whereby a generated response is amended using the KG. NEURAL PATH HUNTER leverages a separate tokenlevel fact critic to identify plausible sources of hallucination followed by a refinement stage that retrieves correct entities by crafting a query signal that is propagated over a k-hop subgraph. We empirically validate our proposed approach on the OpenDialKG dataset (Moon et al., 2019) against a suite of metrics and report a relative improvement of faithfulness over dialogue responses by 20.35% based on FeQA (Durmus et al., 2020).

233296292,SimCSE: Simple Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings,"This paper presents SimCSE, a simple contrastive learning framework that greatly advances the state-of-the-art sentence embeddings. We first describe an unsupervised approach, which takes an input sentence and predicts itself in a contrastive objective, with only standard dropout used as noise. This simple method works surprisingly well, performing on par with previous supervised counterparts. We find that dropout acts as minimal data augmentation and removing it leads to a representation collapse. Then, we propose a supervised approach, which incorporates annotated pairs from natural language inference datasets into our contrastive learning framework, by using ""entailment"" pairs as positives and ""contradiction"" pairs as hard negatives. We evaluate SimCSE on standard semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, and our unsupervised and supervised models using BERT base achieve an average of 76.3% and 81.6% Spearman's correlation respectively, a 4.2% and 2.2% improvement compared to previous best results. We also show-both theoretically and empirically-that contrastive learning objective regularizes pre-trained embeddings' anisotropic space to be more uniform, and it better aligns positive pairs when supervised signals are available. 1",,,
233296494,Fantastically Ordered Prompts and Where to Find Them: Overcoming Few-Shot Prompt Order Sensitivity,"When primed with only a handful of training samples, very large, pretrained language models such as GPT-3 have shown competitive results when compared to fully-supervised, finetuned, large, pretrained language models. We demonstrate that the order in which the samples are provided can make the difference between near state-of-the-art and random guess performance: essentially some permutations are ""fantastic"" and some not. We analyse this phenomenon in detail, establishing that: it is present across model sizes (even for the largest current models), it is not related to a specific subset of samples, and that a given good permutation for one model is not transferable to another. While one could use a development set to determine which permutations are performant, this would deviate from the true fewshot setting as it requires additional annotated data. Instead, we use the generative nature of language models to construct an artificial development set and based on entropy statistics of the candidate permutations on this set, we identify performant prompts. Our method yields a 13% relative improvement for GPTfamily models across eleven different established text classification tasks.",,,
233296711,CLIPScore: A Reference-free Evaluation Metric for Image Captioning,"Image captioning has conventionally relied on reference-based automatic evaluations, where machine captions are compared against captions written by humans. This is in contrast to the reference-free manner in which humans assess caption quality.In this paper, we report the surprising empirical finding that CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), a cross-modal model pretrained on 400M im-age+caption pairs from the web, can be used for robust automatic evaluation of image captioning without the need for references. Experiments spanning several corpora demonstrate that our new reference-free metric, CLIPScore, achieves the highest correlation with human judgements, outperforming existing reference-based metrics like CIDEr and SPICE. Information gain experiments demonstrate that CLIPScore, with its tight focus on image-text compatibility, is complementary to existing reference-based metrics that emphasize text-text similarities. Thus, we also present a reference-augmented version, RefCLIPScore, which achieves even higher correlation. Beyond literal description tasks, several case studies reveal domains where CLIPScore performs well (clip-art images, alt-text rating), but also where it is relatively weaker in comparison to reference-based metrics, e.g., news captions that require richer contextual knowledge.",,,
233296808,The Power of Scale for Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning,"In this work, we explore ""prompt tuning,"" a simple yet effective mechanism for learning ""soft prompts"" to condition frozen language models to perform specific downstream tasks. Unlike the discrete text prompts used by GPT-3, soft prompts are learned through backpropagation and can be tuned to incorporate signals from any number of labeled examples. Our end-to-end learned approach outperforms GPT-3's few-shot learning by a large margin. More remarkably, through ablations on model size using T5, we show that prompt tuning becomes more competitive with scale: as models exceed billions of parameters, our method ""closes the gap"" and matches the strong performance of model tuning (where all model weights are tuned). This finding is especially relevant because large models are costly to share and serve and the ability to reuse one frozen model for multiple downstream tasks can ease this burden. Our method can be seen as a simplification of the recently proposed ""prefix tuning"" of Li and Liang (2021) and we provide a comparison to this and other similar approaches. Finally, we show that conditioning a frozen model with soft prompts confers benefits in robustness to domain transfer and enables efficient ""prompt ensembling.""

We introduce a new data set of over 530k anonymized public Facebook posts across 18 languages, labeled with five different emotions. Using multilingual BERT embeddings, we show that emotions can be reliably inferred both within and across languages. Zero-shot learning produces promising results for lowresource languages. Following established theories of basic emotions, we provide a detailed analysis of the possibilities and limits of crosslingual emotion classification. We find that structural and typological similarity between languages facilitates cross-lingual learning, as well as linguistic diversity of training data. Our results suggest that there are commonalities underlying the expression of emotion in different languages. We publicly release the anonymized data for future research.",,,

However, visually impaired people continue to face serious difficulties in getting full access to this important instrument. Our paper aims to present a work in progress whose main goal is to provide blind students and researchers with an adequate method to deal with the different resources that are used in formal semantics. In particular, we intend to adapt the Portuguese Braille system in order to accommodate the most common symbols and formulas used in this kind of approach and to develop pedagogical procedures to facilitate its learnability. By making this formalisation compatible with the Braille coding (either traditional and electronic), we hope to help blind people to learn and use this notation, essential to acquire a better understanding of a great number of semantic properties displayed by natural language.",,,
233407441,Understanding Factuality in Abstractive Summarization with FRANK: A Benchmark for Factuality Metrics,"Modern summarization models generate highly fluent but often factually unreliable outputs. This motivated a surge of metrics attempting to measure the factuality of automatically generated summaries. Due to the lack of common benchmarks, these metrics cannot be compared. Moreover, all these methods treat factuality as a binary concept and fail to provide deeper insights on the kinds of inconsistencies made by different systems. To address these limitations, we devise a typology of factual errors and use it to collect human annotations of generated summaries from state-of-the-art summarization systems for the CNN/DM and XSum datasets. Through these annotations we identify the proportion of different categories of factual errors in various summarization models and benchmark factuality metrics, showing their correlation with human judgement as well as their specific strengths and weaknesses.",,,
233444001,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 ADAPTING TO REWARD PROGRESSIVITY VIA SPECTRAL REINFORCEMENT LEARNING,"In this paper we consider reinforcement learning tasks with progressive rewards; that is, tasks where the rewards tend to increase in magnitude over time. We hypothesise that this property may be problematic for value-based deep reinforcement learning agents, particularly if the agent must first succeed in relatively unrewarding regions of the task in order to reach more rewarding regions. To address this issue, we propose Spectral DQN, which decomposes the reward into frequencies such that the high frequencies only activate when large rewards are found. This allows the training loss to be balanced so that it gives more even weighting across small and large reward regions. In two domains with extreme reward progressivity, where standard value-based methods struggle significantly, Spectral DQN is able to make much farther progress. Moreover, when evaluated on a set of six standard Atari games that do not overtly favour the approach, Spectral DQN remains more than competitive: While it underperforms one of the benchmarks in a single game, it comfortably surpasses the benchmarks in three games. These results demonstrate that the approach is not overfit to its target problem, and suggest that Spectral DQN may have advantages beyond addressing reward progressivity.",,,
233444226,Dynabench: Rethinking Benchmarking in NLP,"We introduce Dynabench, an open-source platform for dynamic dataset creation and model benchmarking. Dynabench runs in a web browser and supports human-and-model-inthe-loop dataset creation: annotators seek to create examples that a target model will misclassify, but that another person will not. In this paper, we argue that Dynabench addresses a critical need in our community: contemporary models quickly achieve outstanding performance on benchmark tasks but nonetheless fail on simple challenge examples and falter in real-world scenarios. With Dynabench, dataset creation, model development, and model assessment can directly inform each other, leading to more robust and informative benchmarks. We report on four initial NLP tasks, illustrating these concepts and highlighting the promise of the platform, and address potential objections to dynamic benchmarking as a new standard for the field.",,,
233740397,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 UNSUPERVISED AUDIOVISUAL SYNTHESIS VIA EXEMPLAR AUTOENCODERS,"We present an unsupervised approach that converts the input speech of any individual into audiovisual streams of potentially-infinitely many output speakers. Our approach builds on simple autoencoders that project out-of-sample data onto the distribution of the training set. We use Exemplar Autoencoders to learn the voice, stylistic prosody, and visual appearance of a specific target exemplar speech. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed approach can be easily extended to an arbitrarily large number of speakers and styles using only 3 minutes of target audio-video data, without requiring any training data for the input speaker. To do so, we learn audiovisual bottleneck representations that capture the structured linguistic content of speech. We outperform prior approaches on both audio and video synthesis, and provide extensive qualitative analysis on our project page",,,

We propose READTWICE 1 , a simple and effective technique that combines several strengths of prior approaches to model long-range dependencies with Transformers. The main idea is to read text in small segments, in parallel, summarizing each segment into a memory table to be used in a second read of the text. We show that the method outperforms models of comparable size on several question answering (QA) datasets and sets a new state of the art on the challenging NarrativeQA task, with questions about entire books.",,,
234335834,Logic-Driven Context Extension and Data Augmentation for Logical Reasoning of Text,"Logical reasoning of text requires identifying critical logical structures in the text and performing inference over them. Existing methods for logical reasoning mainly focus on contextual semantics of text while struggling to explicitly model the logical inference process. In this paper, we not only put forward a logic-driven context extension framework but also propose a logic-driven data augmentation algorithm. The former follows a three-step reasoning paradigm, and each step is respectively to extract logical expressions as elementary reasoning units, symbolically infer the implicit expressions following equivalence laws and extend the context to validate the options. The latter augments literally similar but logically different instances and incorporates contrastive learning to better capture logical information, especially logical negative and conditional relationships. We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets, ReClor and LogiQA. The results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets, and even surpasses human performance on the ReClor dataset. 1",,,
234337605,Improving Named Entity Recognition by External Context Retrieving and Cooperative Learning,"Recent advances in Named EntityRecognition (NER)show that document-level contexts can significantly improve model performance. In many application scenarios, however, such contexts are not available. In this paper, we propose to find external contexts of a sentence by retrieving and selecting a set of semantically relevant texts through a search engine, with the original sentence as the query. We find empirically that the contextual representations computed on the retrieval-based input view, constructed through the concatenation of a sentence and its external contexts, can achieve significantly improved performance compared to the original input view based only on the sentence. Furthermore, we can improve the model performance of both input views by Cooperative Learning, a training method that encourages the two input views to produce similar contextual representations or output label distributions. Experiments show that our approach can achieve new state-of-the-art performance on 8 NER data sets across 5 domains. 1",,,
234358843,LAYER-ADAPTIVE SPARSITY FOR THE MAGNITUDE-BASED PRUNING,"Recent discoveries on neural network pruning reveal that, with a carefully chosen layerwise sparsity, a simple magnitude-based pruning achieves state-of-the-art tradeoff between sparsity and performance. However, without a clear consensus on ""how to choose,"" the layerwise sparsities are mostly selected algorithm-byalgorithm, often resorting to handcrafted heuristics or an extensive hyperparameter search. To fill this gap, we propose a novel importance score for global pruning, coined layer-adaptive magnitude-based pruning (LAMP) score; the score is a rescaled version of weight magnitude that incorporates the model-level 2 distortion incurred by pruning, and does not require any hyperparameter tuning or heavy computation. Under various image classification setups, LAMP consistently outperforms popular existing schemes for layerwise sparsity selection. Furthermore, we observe that LAMP continues to outperform baselines even in weight-rewinding setups, while the connectivity-oriented layerwise sparsity (the strongest baseline overall) performs worse than a simple global magnitude-based pruning in this case. Code: https://github.com/jaeho-lee/layer-adaptive-sparsity Recent discoveries (Gale et al., 2019; Evci et al., 2020) demonstrate that, given an appropriate choice of layerwise sparsity, simply pruning on the basis of weight magnitude yields a surprisingly powerful unstructured pruning scheme. For instance, Gale et al. (2019) evaluates the performance of magnitudebased pruning (MP; Han et al. (2015); Zhu & Gupta(2018)) with an extensive hyperparameter tuning, and shows that MP achieves comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art pruning algorithms that use more complicated importance scores. To arrive at such a performance level, the authors introduce the following handcrafted heuristic: Leave the first convolutional layer fully dense, and prune up to only 80% of weights from the last fully-connected layer; the heuristic is motivated by the sparsity pattern from other state-of-the-art algorithms(Molchanov et al., 2017)and additional experimental/architectural observations. Unfortunately, there is an apparent lack of consensus on ""how to choose the layerwise sparsity"" for the magnitude-based pruning. Instead, the layerwise sparsity is selected mostly on an algorithm-byalgorithm basis. One common method is the global MP criteria (see, e.g., Morcos et al.(2019)), * Work done at KAIST 1 i.e., simultaneously training and pruning arXiv:2010.07611v2 [cs.LG]",,,

To this end, we propose DIALOGSUM, a large-scale labeled dialogue summarization dataset. We conduct empirical analysis on DIALOGSUM using state-of-the-art neural summarizers. Experimental results show unique challenges in dialogue summarization, such as spoken terms, special discourse structures, coreferences and ellipsis, pragmatics and social common sense, which require specific representation learning technologies to better deal with.",,,

However, existing methods solely fuse lexicon features via a shallow and random initialized sequence layer and do not integrate them into the bottom layers of BERT. In this paper, we propose Lexicon Enhanced BERT (LEBERT) for Chinese sequence labelling, which integrates external lexicon knowledge into BERT layers directly by a Lexicon Adapter layer. Compared with the existing methods, our model facilitates deep lexicon knowledge fusion at the lower layers of BERT. Experiments on ten Chinese datasets of three tasks including Named Entity Recognition, Word Segmentation, and Part-of-Speech Tagging, show that LEBERT achieves the stateof-the-art results.",,,
234763248,Link Prediction on N-ary Relational Facts: A Graph-based Approach,"Link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs) is a key research topic. Previous work mainly focused on binary relations, paying less attention to higher-arity relations although they are ubiquitous in real-world KGs. This paper considers link prediction upon n-ary relational facts and proposes a graph-based approach to this task.The key to our approach is to represent the nary structure of a fact as a small heterogeneous graph, and model this graph with edge-biased fully-connected attention. The fully-connected attention captures universal inter-vertex interactions, while with edge-aware attentive biases to particularly encode the graph structure and its heterogeneity. In this fashion, our approach fully models global and local dependencies in each n-ary fact, and hence can more effectively capture associations therein. Extensive evaluation verifies the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. It performs substantially and consistently better than current state-of-the-art across a variety of n-ary relational benchmarks. Our code is publicly available. 1",,,

235097242,Adaptable and Interpretable Neural Memory Over Symbolic Knowledge,"Past research has demonstrated that large neural language models (LMs) encode surprising amounts of factual information: however, augmenting or modifying this information requires modifying a corpus and retraining, which is computationally expensive. To address this problem, we develop a neural LM that includes an interpretable neuro-symbolic KB in the form of a ""fact memory"". Each element of the fact memory is formed from a triple of vectors, where each vector corresponds to a KB entity or relation. Our LM improves performance on knowledge-intensive question-answering tasks, sometimes dramatically, including a 27 point increase in one setting of WebQuestionsSP over a state-of-the-art open-book model, despite using 5% of the parameters. Most interestingly, we demonstrate that the model can be modified, without any re-training, by updating the fact memory.",,,
235097361,MTAG: Modal-Temporal Attention Graph for Unaligned Human Multimodal Language Sequences,"Human communication is multimodal in nature; it is through multiple modalities such as language, voice, and facial expressions, that opinions and emotions are expressed. Data in this domain exhibits complex multi-relational and temporal interactions. Learning from this data is a fundamentally challenging research problem. In this paper, we propose Modal-Temporal Attention Graph (MTAG). MTAG is an interpretable graph-based neural model that provides a suitable framework for analyzing multimodal sequential data. We first introduce a procedure to convert unaligned multimodal sequence data into a graph with heterogeneous nodes and edges that captures the rich interactions across modalities and through time. Then, a novel graph fusion operation, called MTAG fusion, along with a dynamic pruning and read-out technique, is designed to efficiently process this modal-temporal graph and capture various interactions. By learning to focus only on the important interactions within the graph, MTAG achieves state-ofthe-art performance on multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition benchmarks, while utilizing significantly fewer model parameters. 1",,,
235097475,Sliding Selector Network with Dynamic Memory for Extractive Summarization of Long Documents,"Neural-based summarization models suffer from the length limitation of text encoder. Long documents have to been truncated before they are sent to the model, which results in huge loss of summary-relevant contents. To address this issue, we propose the sliding selector network with dynamic memory for extractive summarization of long-form documents, which employs a sliding window to extract summary sentences segment by segment. Moreover, we adopt memory mechanism to preserve and update the history information dynamically, allowing the semantic flow across different windows. Experimental results on two large-scale datasets that consist of scientific papers demonstrate that our model substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art models. Besides, we perform qualitative and quantitative investigations on how our model works and where the performance gain comes from. 1",,,
235097520,SPLAT: Speech-Language Joint Pre-Training for Spoken Language Understanding,"Spoken language understanding (SLU) requires a model to analyze input acoustic signal to understand its linguistic content and make predictions. To boost the models' performance, various pre-training methods have been proposed to learn rich representations from large-scale unannotated speech and text. However, the inherent disparities between the two modalities necessitate a mutual analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel semisupervised learning framework, SPLAT, to jointly pre-train the speech and language modules. Besides conducting a self-supervised masked language modeling task on the two individual modules using unpaired speech and text, SPLAT aligns representations from the two modules in a shared latent space using a small amount of paired speech and text. Thus, during fine-tuning, the speech module alone can produce representations carrying both acoustic information and contextual semantic knowledge of an input acoustic signal. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our approach on various SLU tasks. For example, SPLAT improves the previous stateof-the-art performance on the Spoken SQuAD dataset by more than 10%.",,,
235097662,Fine-grained Post-training for Improving Retrieval-based Dialogue Systems,"Retrieval-based dialogue systems display an outstanding performance when pre-trained language models are used, which includes bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). During the multi-turn response selection, BERT focuses on training the relationship between the context with multiple utterances and the response. However, this method of training is insufficient when considering the relations between each utterance in the context. This leads to a problem of not completely understanding the context flow that is required to select a response. To address this issue, we propose a new fine-grained post-training method that reflects the characteristics of the multi-turn dialogue. Specifically, the model learns the utterance level interactions by training every short context-response pair in a dialogue session. Furthermore, by using a new training objective, the utterance relevance classification, the model understands the semantic relevance and coherence between the dialogue utterances. Experimental results show that our model achieves new state-of-the-art with significant margins on three benchmark datasets. This suggests that the fine-grained post-training method is highly effective for the response selection task. 1",,,
235166394,Prevent the Language Model from being Overconfident in Neural Machine Translation,"The Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model is essentially a joint language model conditioned on both the source sentence and partial translation. Therefore, the NMT model naturally involves the mechanism of the Language Model (LM) that predicts the next token only based on partial translation. Despite its success, NMT still suffers from the hallucination problem, generating fluent but inadequate translations. The main reason is that NMT pays excessive attention to the partial translation while neglecting the source sentence to some extent, namely overconfidence of the LM. Accordingly, we define the Margin between the NMT and the LM, calculated by subtracting the predicted probability of the LM from that of the NMT model for each token. The Margin is negatively correlated to the overconfidence degree of the LM. Based on the property, we propose a Margin-based Token-level Objective (MTO) and a Margin-based Sentencelevel Objective (MSO) to maximize the Margin for preventing the LM from being overconfident. Experiments on WMT14 Englishto-German, WMT19 Chinese-to-English, and WMT14 English-to-French translation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with 1.36, 1.50, and 0.63 BLEU improvements, respectively, compared to the Transformer baseline.

Though BERT-based pretrained language models achieve high performance on many downstream tasks, the native derived sentence representations are proved to be collapsed and thus produce a poor performance on the semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. In this paper, we present ConSERT, a Contrastive Framework for Self-Supervised SEntence Representation Transfer, that adopts contrastive learning to fine-tune BERT in an unsupervised and effective way. By making use of unlabeled texts, ConSERT solves the collapse issue of BERT-derived sentence representations and make them more applicable for downstream tasks. Experiments on STS datasets demonstrate that ConSERT achieves an 8% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art, even comparable to the supervised SBERT-NLI. And when further incorporating NLI supervision, we achieve new stateof-the-art performance on STS tasks. Moreover, ConSERT obtains comparable results with only 1000 samples available, showing its robustness in data scarcity scenarios.",,,
235196099,Hidden Killer: Invisible Textual Backdoor Attacks with Syntactic Trigger,"Backdoor attacks are a kind of insidious security threat against machine learning models. After being injected with a backdoor in training, the victim model will produce adversaryspecified outputs on the inputs embedded with predesigned triggers but behave properly on normal inputs during inference. As a sort of emergent attack, backdoor attacks in natural language processing (NLP) are investigated insufficiently. As far as we know, almost all existing textual backdoor attack methods insert additional contents into normal samples as triggers, which causes the trigger-embedded samples to be detected and the backdoor attacks to be blocked without much effort. In this paper, we propose to use the syntactic structure as the trigger in textual backdoor attacks. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the syntactic trigger-based attack method can achieve comparable attack performance (almost 100% success rate) to the insertionbased methods but possesses much higher invisibility and stronger resistance to defenses. These results also reveal the significant insidiousness and harmfulness of textual backdoor attacks.

235265909,Language Model Evaluation Beyond Perplexity,"We propose an alternate approach to quantifying how well language models learn natural language: we ask how well they match the statistical tendencies of natural language. To answer this question, we analyze whether text generated from language models exhibits the statistical tendencies present in the humangenerated text on which they were trained. We provide a framework-paired with significance tests-for evaluating the fit of language models to these trends. We find that neural language models appear to learn only a subset of the tendencies considered, but align much more closely with empirical trends than proposed theoretical distributions (when present). Further, the fit to different distributions is highly-dependent on both model architecture and generation strategy. As concrete examples, text generated under the nucleus sampling scheme adheres more closely to the typetoken relationship of natural language than text produced using standard ancestral sampling; text from LSTMs reflects the natural language distributions over length, stopwords, and symbols surprisingly well.",,,
235293845,DIALOGRAPH: INCORPORATING INTERPRETABLE STRATEGY-GRAPH NETWORKS INTO NEGOTIATION DIALOGUES,"To successfully negotiate a deal, it is not enough to communicate fluently: pragmatic planning of persuasive negotiation strategies is essential. While modern dialogue agents excel at generating fluent sentences, they still lack pragmatic grounding and cannot reason strategically. We present DIALOGRAPH, a negotiation system that incorporates pragmatic strategies in a negotiation dialogue using graph neural networks. DIALOGRAPH explicitly incorporates dependencies between sequences of strategies to enable improved and interpretable prediction of next optimal strategies, given the dialogue context. Our graph-based method outperforms prior state-of-the-art negotiation models both in the accuracy of strategy/dialogue act prediction and in the quality of downstream dialogue response generation. We qualitatively show further benefits of learned strategy-graphs in providing explicit associations between effective negotiation strategies over the course of the dialogue, leading to interpretable and strategic dialogues. 1",,,
235294032,PP-Rec: News Recommendation with Personalized User Interest and Time-aware News Popularity,"Personalized news recommendation methods are widely used in online news services. These methods usually recommend news based on the matching between news content and user interest inferred from historical behaviors. However, these methods usually have difficulties in making accurate recommendations to cold-start users, and tend to recommend similar news with those users have read. In general, popular news usually contain important information and can attract users with different interests. Besides, they are usually diverse in content and topic. Thus, in this paper we propose to incorporate news popularity information to alleviate the cold-start and diversity problems for personalized news recommendation. In our method, the ranking score for recommending a candidate news to a target user is the combination of a personalized matching score and a news popularity score. The former is used to capture the personalized user interest in news. The latter is used to measure timeaware popularity of candidate news, which is predicted based on news content, recency, and real-time CTR using a unified framework. Besides, we propose a popularity-aware user encoder to eliminate the popularity bias in user behaviors for accurate interest modeling. Experiments on two real-world datasets show our method can effectively improve the accuracy and diversity for news recommendation.",,,
235294159,Generating Informative Conclusions for Argumentative Texts,"The purpose of an argumentative text is to support a certain conclusion. Yet, they are often omitted, expecting readers to infer them rather. While appropriate when reading an individual text, this rhetorical device limits accessibility when browsing many texts (e.g., on a search engine or on social media). In these scenarios, an explicit conclusion makes for a good candidate summary of an argumentative text. This is especially true if the conclusion is informative, emphasizing specific concepts from the text. With this paper we introduce the task of generating informative conclusions: First, Webis-ConcluGen-21 is compiled, a large-scale corpus of 136,996 samples of argumentative texts and their conclusions. Second, two paradigms for conclusion generation are investigated; one extractive, the other abstractive in nature. The latter exploits argumentative knowledge that augment the data via control codes and finetuning the BART model on several subsets of the corpus. Third, insights are provided into the suitability of our corpus for the task, the differences between the two generation paradigms, the trade-off between informativeness and conciseness, and the impact of encoding argumentative knowledge. The corpus, code, and the trained models are publicly available. 1",,,
235303644,Leveraging Abstract Meaning Representation for Knowledge Base Question Answering,"Knowledge base question answering (KBQA) is an important task in Natural Language Processing. Existing approaches face significant challenges including complex question understanding, necessity for reasoning, and lack of large end-to-end training datasets. In this work, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Question Answering (NSQA), a modular KBQA system, that leverages (1) Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parses for task-independent question understanding; (2) a simple yet effective graph transformation approach to convert AMR parses into candidate logical queries that are aligned to the KB; (3) a pipeline-based approach which integrates multiple, reusable modules that are trained specifically for their individual tasks (semantic parser, entity and relationship linkers, and neuro-symbolic reasoner) and do not require end-to-end training data. NSQA achieves state-of-the-art performance on two prominent KBQA datasets based on DBpedia (QALD-9 and LC-QuAD 1.0). Furthermore, our analysis emphasizes that AMR is a powerful tool for KBQA systems.",,,

Yet, human annotators usually use a small number of sentences to identify the relationship between a given entity pair. In this paper, we present an embarrassingly simple but effective method to heuristically select evidence sentences for document-level RE, which can be easily combined with BiLSTM to achieve good performance on benchmark datasets, even better than fancy graph neural network based methods.

235313508,Question Answering Over Temporal Knowledge Graphs,"Temporal Knowledge Graphs (Temporal KGs) extend regular Knowledge Graphs by providing temporal scopes (e.g., start and end times) on each edge in the KG. While Question Answering over KG (KGQA) has received some attention from the research community, QA over Temporal KGs (Temporal KGQA) is a relatively unexplored area. Lack of broadcoverage datasets has been another factor limiting progress in this area. We address this challenge by presenting CRONQUESTIONS, the largest known Temporal KGQA dataset, clearly stratified into buckets of structural complexity. CRONQUESTIONS expands the only known previous dataset by a factor of 340×. We find that various state-of-the-art KGQA methods fall far short of the desired performance on this new dataset. In response, we also propose CRONKGQA, a transformerbased solution that exploits recent advances in Temporal KG embeddings, and achieves performance superior to all baselines, with an increase of 120% in accuracy over the next best performing method. Through extensive experiments, we give detailed insights into the workings of CRONKGQA, as well as situations where significant further improvements appear possible. In addition to the dataset, we have released our code as well.",,,
235313818,PsyQA: A Chinese Dataset for Generating Long Counseling Text for Mental Health Support,"Great research interests have been attracted to devise AI services that are able to provide mental health support. However, the lack of corpora is a main obstacle to this research, particularly in Chinese language. In this paper, we propose PsyQA, a Chinese dataset of psychological health support in the form of question and answer pair. PsyQA is crawled from a Chinese mental health service platform, and contains 22K questions and 56K long and wellstructured answers. Based on the psychological counseling theories, we annotate a portion of answer texts with typical strategies for providing support, and further present in-depth analysis of both lexical features and strategy patterns in the counseling answers. We also evaluate the performance of generating counseling answers with the generative pretrained models. Results show that utilizing strategies enhances the fluency and helpfulness of generated answers, but there is still a large space for future research.",,,
235313967,DEXPERTS: Decoding-Time Controlled Text Generation with Experts and Anti-Experts,"Despite recent advances in natural language generation, it remains challenging to control attributes of generated text. We propose DEX-PERTS: Decoding-time Experts, a decodingtime method for controlled text generation that combines a pretrained language model with ""expert"" LMs and/or ""anti-expert"" LMs in a product of experts. Intuitively, under the ensemble, tokens only get high probability if they are considered likely by the experts and unlikely by the anti-experts. We apply DEXPERTS to language detoxification and sentiment-controlled generation, where we outperform existing controllable generation methods on both automatic and human evaluations. Moreover, because DEXPERTS operates only on the output of the pretrained LM, it is effective with (anti-)experts of smaller size, including when operating on GPT-3. Our work highlights the promise of tuning small LMs on text with (un)desirable attributes for efficient decoding-time steering.",,,
235358586,GTM: A Generative Triple-Wise Model for Conversational Question Generation,"Generating some appealing questions in opendomain conversations is an effective way to improve human-machine interactions and lead the topic to a broader or deeper direction. To avoid dull or deviated questions, some researchers tried to utilize answer, the ""future"" information, to guide question generation. However, they separate a post-questionanswer (PQA) triple into two parts: postquestion (PQ) and question-answer (QA) pairs, which may hurt the overall coherence. Besides, the QA relationship is modeled as a one-to-one mapping that is not reasonable in open-domain conversations. To tackle these problems, we propose a generative triple-wise model with hierarchical variations for open-domain conversational question generation (CQG). Latent variables in three hierarchies are used to represent the shared background of a triple and one-to-many semantic mappings in both PQ and QA pairs. Experimental results on a largescale CQG dataset show that our method significantly improves the quality of questions in terms of fluency, coherence and diversity over competitive baselines.",,,

However, the data collection process can be time consuming and presents many challenges to ensure data quality. Since language generation has improved immensely in recent years with the advancement of pretrained language models, we investigate how such models can be utilized to generate entire conversations, given only a summary of a conversation as the input. We explore three approaches to generate summary grounded conversations, and evaluate the generated conversations using automatic measures and human judgements. We also show that the accuracy of conversation summarization can be improved by augmenting a conversation summarization dataset with generated conversations.",,,
235368202,HieRec: Hierarchical User Interest Modeling for Personalized News Recommendation,"User interest modeling is critical for personalized news recommendation. Existing news recommendation methods usually learn a single user embedding for each user from their previous behaviors to represent their overall interest. However, user interest is usually diverse and multi-grained, which is difficult to be accurately modeled by a single user embedding. In this paper, we propose a news recommendation method with hierarchical user interest modeling, named HieRec. Instead of a single user embedding, in our method each user is represented in a hierarchical interest tree to better capture their diverse and multi-grained interest in news. We use a three-level hierarchy to represent 1) overall user interest; 2) user interest in coarse-grained topics like sports; and 3) user interest in fine-grained topics like football. Moreover, we propose a hierarchical user interest matching framework to match candidate news with different levels of user interest for more accurate user interest targeting. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets validate our method can effectively improve the performance of user modeling for personalized news recommendation.",,,
235417023,Adversarial Robustness through the Lens of Causality,"The adversarial vulnerability of deep neural networks has attracted significant attention in machine learning. From a causal viewpoint, adversarial attacks can be considered as a specific type of distribution change on natural data. As causal reasoning has an instinct for modeling distribution change, we propose to incorporate causality into mitigating adversarial vulnerability. However, causal formulations of the intuition of adversarial attack and the development of robust DNNs are still lacking in the literature. To bridge this gap, we construct a causal graph to model the generation process of adversarial examples and define the adversarial distribution to formalize the intuition of adversarial attacks. From a causal perspective, we find that the label is spuriously correlated with the style (content-independent) information when an instance is given. The spurious correlation implies that the adversarial distribution is constructed via making the statistical conditional association between style information and labels drastically different from that in natural distribution. Thus, DNNs that fit the spurious correlation are vulnerable to the adversarial distribution. Inspired by the observation, we propose the adversarial distribution alignment method to eliminate the difference between the natural distribution and the adversarial distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. Our method can be seen as the first attempt to leverage causality for mitigating adversarial vulnerability. * Work done during an internship at Hong Kong Baptist University.",,,
235417102,Turn the Combination Lock: Learnable Textual Backdoor Attacks via Word Substitution,"Recent studies show that neural natural language processing (NLP) models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Injected with backdoors, models perform normally on benign examples but produce attacker-specified predictions when the backdoor is activated, presenting serious security threats to real-world applications. Since existing textual backdoor attacks pay little attention to the invisibility of backdoors, they can be easily detected and blocked. In this work, we present invisible backdoors that are activated by a learnable combination of word substitution. We show that NLP models can be injected with backdoors that lead to a nearly 100% attack success rate, whereas being highly invisible to existing defense strategies and even human inspections. The results raise a serious alarm to the security of NLP models, which requires further research to be resolved.

235421599,Semi-Supervised Data Programming with Subset Selection,"The paradigm of data programming, which uses weak supervision in the form of rules/labelling functions, and semi-supervised learning, which augments small amounts of labelled data with a large unlabelled dataset, have shown great promise in several text classification scenarios. In this work, we argue that by not using any labelled data, data programming based approaches can yield sub-optimal performances, particularly when the labelling functions are noisy. The first contribution of this work is an introduction of a framework, SPEAR which is a semi-supervised data programming paradigm that learns a joint model that effectively uses the rules/labelling functions along with semi-supervised loss functions on the feature space. Next, we also study SPEAR-SS which additionally does subset selection on top of the joint semi-supervised data programming objective and selects a set of examples that can be used as the labelled set by SPEAR. The goal of SPEAR-SS is to ensure that the labelled data can complement the labelling functions, thereby benefiting from both data-programming as well as appropriately selected data for human labelling. We demonstrate that by effectively combining semi-supervision, data-programming, and subset selection paradigms, we significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art on seven publicly available datasets. 1",,,
235422047,Contrastive Attention for Automatic Chest X-ray Report Generation,"Recently, chest X-ray report generation, which aims to automatically generate descriptions of given chest X-ray images, has received growing research interests. The key challenge of chest X-ray report generation is to accurately capture and describe the abnormal regions. In most cases, the normal regions dominate the entire chest X-ray image, and the corresponding descriptions of these normal regions dominate the final report. Due to such data bias, learning-based models may fail to attend to abnormal regions. In this work, to effectively capture and describe abnormal regions, we propose the Contrastive Attention (CA) model. Instead of solely focusing on the current input image, the CA model compares the current input image with normal images to distill the contrastive information. The acquired contrastive information can better represent the visual features of abnormal regions. According to the experiments on the public IU-X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, incorporating our CA into several existing models can boost their performance across most metrics. In addition, according to the analysis, the CA model can help existing models better attend to the abnormal regions and provide more accurate descriptions which are crucial for an interpretable diagnosis. Specifically, we achieve the state-ofthe-art results on the two public datasets.",,,
235422257,Memory-efficient Transformers via Top-k Attention,"Following the success of dot-product attention in Transformers, numerous approximations have been recently proposed to address its quadratic complexity with respect to the input length. While these variants are memory and compute efficient, it is not possible to directly use them with popular pre-trained language models trained using vanilla attention, without an expensive corrective pre-training stage. In this work, we propose a simple yet highly accurate approximation for vanilla attention. We process the queries in chunks, and for each query, compute the top-k scores with respect to the keys. Our approach offers several advantages: (a) its memory usage is linear in the input size, similar to linear attention variants, such as Performer and RFA (b) it is a drop-in replacement for vanilla attention that does not require any corrective pre-training, and (c) it can also lead to significant memory savings in the feed-forward layers after casting them into the familiar query-key-value framework. We evaluate the quality of top-k approximation for multi-head attention layers on the Long Range Arena Benchmark, and for feedforward layers of T5 and UnifiedQA on multiple QA datasets. We show our approach leads to accuracy that is nearly-identical to vanilla attention in multiple setups including training from scratch, fine-tuning, and zero-shot inference. * majority of work done while author was part of IBM AI Residency program. 2020.

235446386,Named Entity Recognition with Small Strongly Labeled and Large Weakly Labeled Data,"Weak supervision has shown promising results in many natural language processing tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). Existing work mainly focuses on learning deep NER models only with weak supervision, i.e., without any human annotation, and shows that by merely using weakly labeled data, one can achieve good performance, though still underperforms fully supervised NER with manually/strongly labeled data. In this paper, we consider a more practical scenario, where we have both a small amount of strongly labeled data and a large amount of weakly labeled data. Unfortunately, we observe that weakly labeled data does not necessarily improve, or even deteriorate the model performance (due to the extensive noise in the weak labels) when we train deep NER models over a simple or weighted combination of the strongly labeled and weakly labeled data. To address this issue, we propose a new multi-stage computational framework -NEEDLE with three essential ingredients: (1) weak label completion, (2) noise-aware loss function, and (3) final finetuning over the strongly labeled data. Through experiments on E-commerce query NER and Biomedical NER, we demonstrate that NEE-DLE can effectively suppress the noise of the weak labels and outperforms existing methods. In particular, we achieve new SOTA F1-scores on 3 Biomedical NER datasets: BC5CDRchem 93.74, BC5CDR-disease 90.69, NCBIdisease 92.28.Gamal Crichton, Sampo Pyysalo, Billy Chiu, and AnnaKorhonen. 2017.

Examples of such challenges include unstructured information exchange in dialogues, informal interactions between speakers, and dynamic role changes of speakers as the dialogue evolves. Many of such challenges result in complex coreference links. Therefore, in this work, we investigate different approaches to explicitly incorporate coreference information in neural abstractive dialogue summarization models to tackle the aforementioned challenges. Experimental results show that the proposed approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance, implying it is useful to utilize coreference information in dialogue summarization. Evaluation results on factual correctness suggest such coreferenceaware models are better at tracing the information flow among interlocutors and associating accurate status/actions with the corresponding interlocutors and person mentions.",,,
235458429,TEXT2EVENT: Controllable Sequence-to-Structure Generation for End-to-end Event Extraction,"Event extraction is challenging due to the complex structure of event records and the semantic gap between text and event. Traditional methods usually extract event records by decomposing the complex structure prediction task into multiple subtasks. In this paper, we propose TEXT2EVENT, a sequence-to-structure generation paradigm that can directly extract events from the text in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we design a sequence-to-structure network for unified event extraction, a constrained decoding algorithm for event knowledge injection during inference, and a curriculum learning algorithm for efficient model learning. Experimental results show that, by uniformly modeling all tasks in a single model and universally predicting different labels, our method can achieve competitive performance using only record-level annotations in both supervised learning and transfer learning settings.",,,
235613377,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 RAPID NEURAL ARCHITECTURE SEARCH BY LEARNING TO GENERATE GRAPHS FROM DATASETS,"Despite the success of recent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods on various tasks which have shown to output networks that largely outperform humandesigned networks, conventional NAS methods have mostly tackled the optimization of searching for the network architecture for a single task (dataset), which does not generalize well across multiple tasks (datasets). Moreover, since such task-specific methods search for a neural architecture from scratch for every given task, they incur a large computational cost, which is problematic when the time and monetary budget are limited. In this paper, we propose an efficient NAS framework that is trained once on a database consisting of datasets and pretrained networks and can rapidly search for a neural architecture for a novel dataset. The proposed MetaD2A (Meta Dataset-to-Architecture) model can stochastically generate graphs (architectures) from a given set (dataset) via a cross-modal latent space learned with amortized meta-learning. Moreover, we also propose a meta-performance predictor to estimate and select the best architecture without direct training on target datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our model meta-learned on subsets of ImageNet-1K and architectures from NAS-Bench 201 search space successfully generalizes to multiple unseen datasets including CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with an average search time of 33 GPU seconds. Even under MobileNetV3 search space, MetaD2A is 5.5K times faster than NSGANetV2, a transferable NAS method, with comparable performance. We believe that the MetaD2A proposes a new research direction for rapid NAS as well as ways to utilize the knowledge from rich databases of datasets and architectures accumulated over the past years.

235613625,"Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 AUXILIARY TASK UPDATE DECOMPOSITION: THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE NEUTRAL","While deep learning has been very beneficial in data-rich settings, tasks with smaller training set often resort to pre-training or multitask learning to leverage data from other tasks. In this case, careful consideration is needed to select tasks and model parameterizations such that updates from the auxiliary tasks actually help the primary task. We seek to alleviate this burden by formulating a modelagnostic framework that performs fine-grained manipulation of the auxiliary task gradients. We propose to decompose auxiliary updates into directions which help, damage or leave the primary task loss unchanged. This allows weighting the update directions differently depending on their impact on the problem of interest. We present a novel and efficient algorithm for that purpose and show its advantage in practice. Our method leverages efficient automatic differentiation procedures and randomized singular value decomposition for scalability. We show that our framework is generic and encompasses some prior work as particular cases. Our approach consistently outperforms strong and widely used baselines when leveraging out-of-distribution data for Text and Image classification tasks.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 encompasses prior methods such as classical multitask learning (Caruana, 1997) or more novel gradient surgery techniques(Yu et al., 2020). To achieve a tractable approach, we introduce an efficient, robust algorithm (ATTITTUD, Auxiliary Task Training with Influence from Target Task Update Direction) to estimate the subspace spanned by the primary task gradients in an online manner and decompose the auxiliary updates appropriately. As a result, we can integrate our approach with the stochastic training of large neural networks in various contexts.The contribution of our work is four-fold. To our knowledge, this paper proposes the first approach to adapt auxiliary gradients using a decomposition built from the span of the primary task Jacobian. In order to scale this approach to deep neural nets, we contribute a tractable and efficient algorithm called ATTITTUD that leverages insights from randomized linear algebra and automatic differentiation such as the R-operator(Pearlmutter, 1994). As our third contribution, we show that the fine-grained manipulation of the auxiliary task gradients under ATTITTUD, represents a unified framework that encompasses several previous approaches to asymmetrical task learning as special cases. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in both data-rich and data-starved primary tasks, over both images and textual data.",,,

235669650,On the Interaction of Belief Bias and Explanations,"A myriad of explainability methods have been proposed in recent years, but there is little consensus on how to evaluate them. While automatic metrics allow for quick benchmarking, it isn't clear how such metrics reflect human interaction with explanations. Human evaluation is of paramount importance, but previous protocols fail to account for belief biases affecting human performance, which may lead to misleading conclusions. We provide an overview of belief bias, its role in human evaluation, and ideas for NLP practitioners on how to account for it. For two experimental paradigms, we present a case study of gradientbased explainability introducing simple ways to account for humans' prior beliefs: models of varying quality and adversarial examples. We show that conclusions about the highest performing methods change when introducing such controls, pointing to the importance of accounting for belief bias in evaluation.",,,

We run a study assessing nonexperts' ability to distinguish between humanand machine-authored text (GPT2 and GPT3) in three domains (stories, news articles, and recipes). We find that, without training, evaluators distinguished between GPT3-and humanauthored text at random chance level. We explore three approaches for quickly training evaluators to better identify GPT3-authored text (detailed instructions, annotated examples, and paired examples) and find that while evaluators' accuracy improved up to 55%, it did not significantly improve across the three domains. Given the inconsistent results across text domains and the often contradictory reasons evaluators gave for their judgments, we examine the role untrained human evaluations play in NLG evaluation and provide recommendations to NLG researchers for improving human evaluations of text generated from state-of-the-art models.",,,
235720578,In-Batch Negatives for Knowledge Distillation with Tightly-Coupled Teachers for Dense Retrieval,"We present an efficient training approach to text retrieval with dense representations that applies knowledge distillation using the Col-BERT late-interaction ranking model. Specifically, we propose to transfer the knowledge from a bi-encoder teacher to a student by distilling knowledge from ColBERT's expressive MaxSim operator into a simple dot product. The advantage of the bi-encoder teacherstudent setup is that we can efficiently add inbatch negatives during knowledge distillation, enabling richer interactions between teacher and student models. In addition, using Col-BERT as the teacher reduces training cost compared to a full cross-encoder. Experiments on the MS MARCO passage and document ranking tasks and data from the TREC 2019 Deep Learning Track demonstrate that our approach helps models learn robust representations for dense retrieval effectively and efficiently.",,,
235795764,SOURCE-FREE ADAPTATION TO MEASUREMENT SHIFT VIA BOTTOM-UP FEATURE RESTORATION,"Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a model trained on labelled data in a source domain to unlabelled data in a target domain without access to the source-domain data during adaptation. Existing methods for SFDA leverage entropy-minimization techniques which: (i) apply only to classification; (ii) destroy model calibration; and (iii) rely on the source model achieving a good level of feature-space class-separation in the target domain. We address these issues for a particularly pervasive type of domain shift called measurement shift which can be resolved by restoring the source features rather than extracting new ones. In particular, we propose Feature Restoration (FR) wherein we: (i) store a lightweight and flexible approximation of the feature distribution under the source data; and (ii) adapt the feature-extractor such that the approximate feature distribution under the target data realigns with that saved on the source. We additionally propose a bottomup training scheme which boosts performance, which we call Bottom-Up Feature Restoration (BUFR). On real and synthetic data, we demonstrate that BUFR outperforms existing SFDA methods in terms of accuracy, calibration, and data efficiency, while being less reliant on the performance of the source model in the target domain.Recently, there has been increasing interest in methods to address this setting of source-free domain adaptation (SFDA, Kundu et al. 2020; Liang et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020; Morerio et al. 2020)  where the source dataset is unavailable during adaptation in the deployment phase. However, to adapt to the target domain, most of these methods employ entropy-minimization techniques which: (i) apply only to classification (discrete labels); (ii) destroy model calibration-minimizing prediction-entropy causes every sample to be classified (correctly or incorrectly) with extreme confidence; and (iii) assume that, in the target domain, the feature space of the unadapted source model contains reasonably well-separated data clusters, where samples within a cluster tend to share the same class label.

235828929,HIDDEN CONVEXITY OF WASSERSTEIN GANS: INTERPRETABLE GENERATIVE MODELS WITH CLOSED-FORM SOLUTIONS,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are commonly used for modeling complex distributions of data. Both the generators and discriminators of GANs are often modeled by neural networks, posing a non-transparent optimization problem which is non-convex and non-concave over the generator and discriminator, respectively. Such networks are often heuristically optimized with gradient descent-ascent (GDA), but it is unclear whether the optimization problem contains any saddle points, or whether heuristic methods can find them in practice. In this work, we analyze the training of Wasserstein GANs with two-layer neural network discriminators through the lens of convex duality, and for a variety of generators expose the conditions under which Wasserstein GANs can be solved exactly with convex optimization approaches, or can be represented as convex-concave games. Using this convex duality interpretation, we further demonstrate the impact of different activation functions of the discriminator.

236034497,Beyond Goldfish Memory * : Long-Term Open-Domain Conversation,"Despite recent improvements in open-domain dialogue models, state-of-the-art models are trained and evaluated on short conversations with little context. In contrast, the long-term conversation setting has hardly been studied. In this work we collect and release a humanhuman dataset consisting of multiple chat sessions whereby the speaking partners learn about each other's interests and discuss the things they have learnt from past sessions. We show how existing models trained on existing datasets perform poorly in this long-term conversation setting in both automatic and human evaluations, and we study long-context models that can perform much better. In particular, we find retrieval-augmented methods and methods with an ability to summarize and recall previous conversations outperform the standard encoder-decoder architectures currently considered state-of-the-art. * We use this term colloquially, seeAgranoff et al.

236034557,Internet-Augmented Dialogue Generation,"The largest store of continually updating knowledge on our planet can be accessed via internet search. In this work we study giving access to this information to conversational agents. Large language models, even though they store an impressive amount of knowledge within their weights, are known to hallucinate facts when generating dialogue (Shuster et al., 2021); moreover, those facts are frozen in time at the point of model training. In contrast, we propose an approach that learns to generate an internet search query based on the context, and then conditions on the search results to finally generate a response, a method that can employ up-to-the-minute relevant information. We train and evaluate such models on a newly collected dataset of human-human conversations whereby one of the speakers is given access to internet search during knowledge-driven discussions in order to ground their responses. We find that search-query based access of the internet in conversation provides superior performance compared to existing approaches that either use no augmentation or FAISS-based retrieval (Lewis et al., 2020b). . 2020.

236087352,HIERARCHICAL FEW-SHOT IMITATION WITH SKILL TRANSITION MODELS,"A desirable property of autonomous agents is the ability to both solve long-horizon problems and generalize to unseen tasks. Recent advances in data-driven skill learning have shown that extracting behavioral priors from offline data can enable agents to solve challenging long-horizon tasks with reinforcement learning. However, generalization to tasks unseen during behavioral prior training remains an outstanding challenge. To this end, we present Few-shot Imitation with Skill Transition Models (FIST), an algorithm that extracts skills from offline data and utilizes them to generalize to unseen tasks given a few downstream demonstrations. FIST learns an inverse skill dynamics model, a distance function, and utilizes a semi-parametric approach for imitation. We show that FIST is capable of generalizing to new tasks and substantially outperforms prior baselines in navigation experiments requiring traversing unseen parts of a large maze and 7-DoF robotic arm experiments requiring manipulating previously unseen objects in a kitchen. arXiv:2107.08981v2 [cs.LG]",,,

236428851,Transferable Dialogue Systems and User Simulators,"One of the difficulties in training dialogue systems is the lack of training data. We explore the possibility of creating dialogue data through the interaction between a dialogue system and a user simulator. Our goal is to develop a modelling framework that can incorporate new dialogue scenarios through self-play between the two agents. In this framework, we first pre-train the two agents on a collection of source domain dialogues, which equips the agents to converse with each other via natural language. With further fine-tuning on a small amount of target domain data, the agents continue to interact with the aim of improving their behaviors using reinforcement learning with structured reward functions. In experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, two practical transfer learning problems are investigated: 1) domain adaptation and 2) single-to-multiple domain transfer. We demonstrate that the proposed framework is highly effective in bootstrapping the performance of the two agents in transfer learning. We also show that our method leads to improvements in dialogue system performance on complete datasets.",,,

Since manual coding is very laborious and prone to errors, many methods have been proposed for the automatic ICD coding task. However, existing works either ignore the long-tail of code frequency or the noisy clinical notes. To address the above issues, we propose an Interactive Shared Representation Network with Self-Distillation mechanism. Specifically, an interactive shared representation network targets building connections among codes while modeling the cooccurrence, consequently alleviating the longtail problem. Moreover, to cope with the noisy text issue, we encourage the model to focus on the clinical note's noteworthy part and extract valuable information through a self-distillation learning mechanism. Experimental results on two MIMIC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",,,
236459933,Rethinking Stealthiness of Backdoor Attack against NLP Models,"Recent researches have shown that large natural language processing (NLP) models are vulnerable to a kind of security threat called the Backdoor Attack. Backdoor attacked models can achieve good performance on clean test sets but perform badly on those input sentences injected with designed trigger words. In this work, we point out a potential problem of current backdoor attacking research: its evaluation ignores the stealthiness of backdoor attacks, and most of existing backdoor attacking methods are not stealthy either to system deployers or to system users. To address this issue, we first propose two additional stealthiness-based metrics to make the backdoor attacking evaluation more credible. We further propose a novel word-based backdoor attacking method based on negative data augmentation and modifying word embeddings, making an important step towards achieving stealthy backdoor attacking. Experiments on sentiment analysis and toxic detection tasks show that our method is much stealthier while maintaining pretty good attacking performance.

236459946,PhotoChat: A Human-Human Dialogue Dataset with Photo Sharing Behavior for Joint Image-Text Modeling,"We present a new human-human dialogue dataset -PhotoChat, the first dataset that casts light on the photo sharing behavior in online messaging. PhotoChat contains 12k dialogues, each of which is paired with a user photo that is shared during the conversation. Based on this dataset, we propose two tasks to facilitate research on image-text modeling: a photo-sharing intent prediction task that predicts whether one intends to share a photo in the next conversation turn, and a photo retrieval task that retrieves the most relevant photo according to the dialogue context. In addition, for both tasks, we provide baseline models using the state-of-the-art models and report their benchmark performances. The best image retrieval model achieves 10.4% re-call@1 (out of 1000 candidates) and the best photo intent prediction model achieves 58.1% F1 score, indicating that the dataset presents interesting yet challenging real-world problems. We are releasing PhotoChat to facilitate future research work among the community.",,,
236460018,Towards Table-to-Text Generation with Numerical Reasoning,"Recent neural text generation models have shown significant improvement in generating descriptive text from structured data such as table formats. One of the remaining important challenges is generating more analytical descriptions that can be inferred from facts in a data source. The use of a template-based generator and a pointer-generator is among the potential alternatives for table-to-text generators. In this paper, we propose a framework consisting of a pre-trained model and a copy mechanism. The pre-trained models are fine-tuned to produce fluent text that is enriched with numerical reasoning. However, it still lacks fidelity to the table contents. The copy mechanism is incorporated in the fine-tuning step by using general placeholders to avoid producing hallucinated phrases that are not supported by a table while preserving high fluency. In summary, our contributions are (1) a new dataset for numerical table-to-text generation using pairs of a table and a paragraph of a table description with richer inference from scientific papers, and (2) a table-to-text generation framework enriched with numerical reasoning.",,,
236460056,Hierarchy-aware Label Semantics Matching Network for Hierarchical Text Classification,"Hierarchical text classification is an important yet challenging task due to the complex structure of the label hierarchy. Existing methods ignore the semantic relationship between text and labels, so they cannot make full use of the hierarchical information. To this end, we formulate the text-label semantics relationship as a semantic matching problem and thus propose a hierarchy-aware label semantics matching network (HiMatch). First, we project text semantics and label semantics into a joint embedding space. We then introduce a joint embedding loss and a matching learning loss to model the matching relationship between the text semantics and the label semantics. Our model captures the text-label semantics matching relationship among coarse-grained labels and fine-grained labels in a hierarchy-aware manner. The experimental results on various benchmark datasets verify that our model achieves state-of-the-art results.",,,

We set out to make use of this data by collecting the stance expressed by Twitter users, with respect to topics revolving around the pandemic. We annotate a new stance detection dataset, called COVID-19-Stance. Using this newly annotated dataset, we train several established stance detection models to ascertain a baseline performance for this specific task. To further improve the performance, we employ self-training and domain adaptation approaches to take advantage of large amounts of unlabeled data and existing stance detection datasets. The dataset, code, and other resources are available on GitHub. 1",,,
236460184,Multimodal Sentiment Detection Based on Multi-channel Graph Neural Networks,"With the popularity of smartphones, we have witnessed the rapid proliferation of multimodal posts on various social media platforms. We observe that the multimodal sentiment expression has specific global characteristics, such as the interdependencies of objects or scenes within the image. However, most previous studies only considered the representation of a single image-text post and failed to capture the global co-occurrence characteristics of the dataset. In this paper, we propose Multi-channel Graph Neural Networks with Sentiment-awareness (MGNNS) for imagetext sentiment detection. Specifically, we first encode different modalities to capture hidden representations. Then, we introduce multichannel graph neural networks to learn multimodal representations based on the global characteristics of the dataset. Finally, we implement multimodal in-depth fusion with the multi-head attention mechanism to predict the sentiment of image-text pairs. Extensive experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for multimodal sentiment detection.",,,

The task could be addressed as supervised sequence labeling, using training data with gold toxic spans provided by the organisers. It could also be treated as rationale extraction, using classifiers trained on potentially larger external datasets of posts manually annotated as toxic or not, without toxic span annotations. For the supervised sequence labeling approach and evaluation purposes, posts previously labeled as toxic were crowd-annotated for toxic spans. Participants submitted their predicted spans for a held-out test set, and were scored using character-based F1.

236460287,Bootstrapped Unsupervised Sentence Representation Learning,"As high-quality labeled data is scarce, unsupervised sentence representation learning has attracted much attention. In this paper, we propose a new framework with a two-branch Siamese Network which maximizes the similarity between two augmented views of each sentence. Specifically, given one augmented view of the input sentence, the online network branch is trained by predicting the representation yielded by the target network of the same sentence under another augmented view. Meanwhile, the target network branch is bootstrapped with a moving average of the online network. The proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on semantic textual similarity (STS) and classification tasks. It can be adopted as a post-training procedure to boost the performance of the supervised methods.

These models have a long history in NLP, and we revisit discriminative reranking for modern neural machine translation models by training a large transformer architecture. This takes as input both the source sentence as well as a list of hypotheses to output a ranked list. The reranker is trained to predict the observed distribution of a desired metric, e.g. BLEU, over the n-best list. Since such a discriminator contains hundreds of millions of parameters, we improve its generalization using pre-training and data augmentation techniques. Experiments on four WMT directions show that our discriminative reranking approach is effective and complementary to existing generative reranking approaches, yielding improvements of up to 4 BLEU over the beam search output.",,,

We introduce a simple yet effective debiasing framework whereby the shallow representations of the main model are used to derive a bias model and both models are trained simultaneously.

In the identification step, the input tokens are sorted into two groups by a novel Primary/Secondary Identification (PSI) algorithm. In the aggregation step, these groups are separately encoded, before being aggregated by a custom designed decoder, which autoregressively generates the paraphrased sentence.

236477655,Word Graph Guided Summarization for Radiology Findings,"Radiology reports play a critical role in communicating medical findings to physicians. In each report, the impression section summarizes essential radiology findings. In clinical practice, writing impression is highly demanded yet time-consuming and prone to errors for radiologists. Therefore, automatic impression generation has emerged as an attractive research direction to facilitate such clinical practice. Existing studies mainly focused on introducing salient word information to the general text summarization framework to guide the selection of the key content in radiology findings. However, for this task, a model needs not only capture the important words in findings but also accurately describe their relations so as to generate highquality impressions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for automatic impression generation, where a word graph is constructed from the findings to record the critical words and their relations, then a Word Graph guided Summarization model (WGSUM) is designed to generate impressions with the help of the word graph. Experimental results on two datasets, OPENI and MIMIC-CXR, confirm the validity and effectiveness of our proposed approach, where the state-of-the-art results are achieved on both datasets. Further experiments are also conducted to analyze the impact of different graph designs to the performance of our method. 1",,,

These approaches are expensive both in terms of their memory requirements as well as compute time, and are particularly ill-suited for long documents. In this paper, we propose an approximation to end-to-end models which scales gracefully to documents of any length. Replacing span representations with token representations, we reduce the time/memory complexity via token windows and nearest neighbor sparsification methods for more efficient antecedent prediction. We show our approach's resulting reduction of training and inference time compared to state-of-the-art methods with only a minimal loss in accuracy.",,,

In this paper, we present P-STANCE, a large stance detection dataset in the political domain, which contains 21,574 labeled tweets. We provide a detailed description of the newly created dataset and develop deep learning models on it. Our best model achieves a macro-average F1-score of 80.53%, which we improve further by using semi-supervised learning.

236478070,Using Social and Linguistic Information to Adapt Pretrained Representations for Political Perspective Identification,"Understanding the political perspective shaping the way events are discussed in the media is increasingly important due to the dramatic change in news distribution. With the advance in text classification models, the performance of political perspective detection is also improving rapidly. However, current deep learning based text models often require a large amount of supervised data for training, which can be very expensive to obtain for this task. Meanwhile, models pre-trained on the general source and task (e.g. BERT) lack the ability to focus on bias-related text span. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that pretrains the text model using signals from the rich social and linguistic context that is readily available, including entity mentions, news sharing, and frame indicators. The pre-trained models benefit from tasks related to bias detection and therefore are easier to train with the bias labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework by experiments on two news bias datasets. The models with pre-training achieve significant improvement in performance and are capable of identifying the text span for bias better.The two articles discuss the presentation of John 1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_ storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol",,,

236478283,Awakening Latent Grounding from Pretrained Language Models for Semantic Parsing,"Recent years pretrained language models (PLMs) hit a success on several downstream tasks, showing their power on modeling language. To better understand and leverage what PLMs have learned, several techniques have emerged to explore syntactic structures entailed by PLMs. However, few efforts have been made to explore grounding capabilities of PLMs, which are also essential. In this paper, we highlight the ability of PLMs to discover which token should be grounded to which concept, if combined with our proposed erasingthen-awakening approach. Empirical studies on four datasets demonstrate that our approach can awaken latent grounding which is understandable to human experts, even if it is not exposed to such labels during training. More importantly, our approach shows great potential to benefit downstream semantic parsing models. Taking text-to-SQL as a case study, we successfully couple our approach with two off-the-shelf parsers, obtaining an absolute improvement of up to 9.8%. * Work done during an internship at Microsoft Research.

236478307,Are Rotten Apples Edible? Challenging Commonsense Inference Ability with Exceptions,"Previous studies have argued that pre-trained language models encode commonsense relational knowledge (e.g. that apples are edible). However, simultaneous work has revealed that such models are often insensitive to context, even ignoring overt contextual cues such as negations. In this paper, we investigate whether masked language models (the BERT family) can move beyond naive associative biases (e.g., apple → edible) when the context warrants (e.g. ranking inedible higher when presented with the information that the apple is rotten). We introduce the WINOVENTI procedure, which adversarially exploits generic associations in masked language models to create model-specific Winograd-style entailment schemas. Using our constructed WINOVENTI challenges set of over 2, 000 schemas, we show that language models in the BERT family experience a steep drop in performance on prompts that require them to pick answers which require reasoning about context (e.g., from 89.8% to 18.4% for BERT LARGE ). We present evidence that language models exhibit different associative biases, suggesting a need for future work in developing and analyzing frameworks similar to WINOVENTI that are tuned to model-specific weaknesses.",,,
236478321,A Text-Centered Shared-Private Framework via Cross-Modal Prediction for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal fusion is a core problem for multimodal sentiment analysis. Previous works usually treat all three modal features equally and implicitly explore the interactions between different modalities. In this paper, we break this kind of methods in two ways. Firstly, we observe that textual modality plays the most important role in multimodal sentiment analysis, and this can be seen from the previous works. Secondly, we observe that comparing to the textual modality, the other two kinds of nontextual modalities (visual and acoustic) can provide two kinds of semantics, shared and private semantics. The shared semantics from the other two modalities can obviously enhance the textual semantics and make the sentiment analysis model more robust, and the private semantics can be complementary to the textual semantics and meanwhile provide different views to improve the performance of sentiment analysis together with the shared semantics. Motivated by these two observations, we propose a text-centered shared-private framework (TCSP) for multimodal fusion, which consists of the cross-modal prediction and sentiment regression parts. Experiments on the MOSEI and MOSI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our shared-private framework, which outperforms all baselines. Furthermore, our approach provides a new way to utilize the unlabeled data for multimodal sentiment analysis.",,,

237363853,Discretized Integrated Gradients for Explaining Language Models,"As a prominent attribution-based explanation algorithm, Integrated Gradients (IG) is widely adopted due to its desirable explanation axioms and the ease of gradient computation. It measures feature importance by averaging the model's output gradient interpolated along a straight-line path in the input data space. However, such straight-line interpolated points are not representative of text data due to the inherent discreteness of the word embedding space. This questions the faithfulness of the gradients computed at the interpolated points and consequently, the quality of the generated explanations. Here we propose Discretized Integrated Gradients (DIG), which allows effective attribution along non-linear interpolation paths. We develop two interpolation strategies for the discrete word embedding space that generates interpolation points that lie close to actual words in the embedding space, yielding more faithful gradient computation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DIG over IG through experimental and human evaluations on multiple sentiment classification datasets.

237372185,Improving Multimodal Fusion with Hierarchical Mutual Information Maximization for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"In multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA), the performance of a model highly depends on the quality of synthesized embeddings. These embeddings are generated from the upstream process called multimodal fusion, which aims to extract and combine the input unimodal raw data to produce a richer multimodal representation. Previous work either back-propagates the task loss or manipulates the geometric property of feature spaces to produce favorable fusion results, which neglects the preservation of critical task-related information that flows from input to the fusion results. In this work, we propose a framework named MultiModal InfoMax (MMIM), which hierarchically maximizes the Mutual Information (MI) in unimodal input pairs (inter-modality) and between multimodal fusion result and unimodal input in order to maintain taskrelated information through multimodal fusion. The framework is jointly trained with the main task (MSA) to improve the performance of the downstream MSA task. To address the intractable issue of MI bounds, we further formulate a set of computationally simple parametric and non-parametric methods to approximate their truth value. Experimental results on the two widely used datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

237386541,CodeT5: Identifier-aware Unified Pre-trained Encoder-Decoder Models for Code Understanding and Generation,"Pre-trained models for Natural Languages (NL) like BERT and GPT have been recently shown to transfer well to Programming Languages (PL) and largely benefit a broad set of code-related tasks. Despite their success, most current methods either rely on an encoder-only (or decoder-only) pre-training that is suboptimal for generation (resp. understanding) tasks or process the code snippet in the same way as NL, neglecting the special characteristics of PL such as token types. We present CodeT5, a unified pre-trained encoder-decoder Transformer model that better leverages the code semantics conveyed from the developer-assigned identifiers. Our model employs a unified framework to seamlessly support both code understanding and generation tasks and allows for multi-task learning. Besides, we propose a novel identifier-aware pre-training task that enables the model to distinguish which code tokens are identifiers and to recover them when they are masked. Furthermore, we propose to exploit the user-written code comments with a bimodal dual generation task for better NL-PL alignment. Comprehensive experiments show that CodeT5 significantly outperforms prior methods on understanding tasks such as code defect detection and clone detection, and generation tasks across various directions including PL-NL, NL-PL, and PL-PL. Further analysis reveals that our model can better capture semantic information from code. Our code and pre-trained models are released at https: //github.com/salesforce/CodeT5.",,,
237420771,,"A Learning hierarchical structures in sequential data-from simple algorithmic patterns to natural language-in a reliable, generalizable way remains a challenging problem for neural language models. Past work has shown that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) struggle to generalize on held-out algorithmic or syntactic patterns without supervision or some inductive bias. To remedy this, many papers have explored augmenting RNNs with various differentiable stacks, by analogy with finite automata and pushdown automata (PDAs). In this paper, we improve the performance of our recently proposed Nondeterministic Stack RNN (NS-RNN), which uses a differentiable data structure that simulates a nondeterministic PDA, with two important changes. First, the model now assigns unnormalized positive weights instead of probabilities to stack actions, and we provide an analysis of why this improves training. Second, the model can directly observe the state of the underlying PDA. Our model achieves lower cross-entropy than all previous stack RNNs on five context-free language modeling tasks (within 0.05 nats of the information-theoretic lower bound), including a task on which the NS-RNN previously failed to outperform a deterministic stack RNN baseline. Finally, we propose a restricted version of the NS-RNN that incrementally processes infinitely long sequences, and we present language modeling results on the Penn Treebank.arXiv:2109.01982v3 [cs.CL] 29 Nov 2022Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 stack RNNs (Grefenstette et al., 2015;Joulin & Mikolov, 2015)which model deterministic stacks, being designed to learn one correct stack operation at each time step. One reason nondeterminism is important is that deterministic CFLs are a proper subset of CFLs. If the analogy with PDAs holds true, then equipping an RNN with a deterministic stack would only enable it to model deterministic CFLs, whereas a nondeterministic stack should enable it to model all CFLs. This is important for natural language processing, as human language is known to be high in syntactic ambiguity.Another benefit of nondeterminism, even on deterministic CFLs, applies to training. In order for a model to receive a reward for an action, it must try the action (that is, give it nonzero probability so that it receives gradient during backpropagation). For example, in the digit-recognition task, a classifier tries all ten digits, and is rewarded for the correct one. But in a stack-augmented model, the space of possible action sequences is very large. Whereas a deterministic stack can only try one of them, a nondeterministic stack can try all of them and always receives a reward for the correct one. But as explained in §3.1, because the NS-RNN's probability for an action sequence is the product of many probabilities, it can be extremely small, so the NS-RNN sometimes learns very slowly.ModelAgr.Lic.

237420821,From Alignment to Assignment: Frustratingly Simple Unsupervised Entity Alignment,"Cross-lingual entity alignment (EA) aims to find the equivalent entities between crosslingual KGs (Knowledge Graphs), which is a crucial step for integrating KGs. Recently, many GNN-based EA methods are proposed and show decent performance improvements on several public datasets. However, existing GNN-based EA methods inevitably inherit poor interpretability and low efficiency from neural networks. Motivated by the isomorphic assumption of GNN-based methods, we successfully transform the cross-lingual EA problem into an assignment problem. Based on this re-definition, we propose a frustratingly Simple but Effective Unsupervised entity alignment method (SEU) without neural networks. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show that our proposed unsupervised approach even beats advanced supervised methods across all public datasets while having high efficiency, interpretability, and stability.",,,
237442211,Label Verbalization and Entailment for Effective Zero-and Few-Shot Relation Extraction,"Relation extraction systems require large amounts of labeled examples which are costly to annotate. In this work we reformulate relation extraction as an entailment task, with simple, hand-made, verbalizations of relations produced in less than 15 minutes per relation. The system relies on a pretrained textual entailment engine which is run as-is (no training examples, zero-shot) or further fine-tuned on labeled examples (few-shot or fully trained). In our experiments on TACRED we attain 63% F1 zero-shot, 69% with 16 examples per relation (17% points better than the best supervised system on the same conditions), and only 4 points short of the state-of-the-art (which uses 20 times more training data). We also show that the performance can be improved significantly with larger entailment models, up to 12 points in zero-shot, giving the best results to date on TACRED when fully trained. The analysis shows that our few-shot systems are especially effective when discriminating between relations, and that the performance difference in low data regimes comes mainly from identifying no-relation cases.",,,
237452236,PPT: Pre-trained Prompt Tuning for Few-shot Learning,"Prompts for pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown remarkable performance by bridging the gap between pre-training tasks and various downstream tasks. Among these methods, prompt tuning, which freezes PLMs and only tunes soft prompts, provides an efficient and effective solution for adapting largescale PLMs to downstream tasks. However, prompt tuning is yet to be fully explored. In our pilot experiments, we find that prompt tuning performs comparably with conventional full-model tuning when downstream data are sufficient, whereas it is much worse under fewshot learning settings, which may hinder the application of prompt tuning. We attribute this low performance to the manner of initializing soft prompts. Therefore, in this work, we propose to pre-train prompts by adding soft prompts into the pre-training stage to obtain a better initialization. We name this Pretrained Prompt Tuning framework ""PPT"". To ensure the generalization of PPT, we formulate similar classification tasks into a unified task form and pre-train soft prompts for this unified task. Extensive experiments show that tuning pre-trained prompts for downstream tasks can reach or even outperform full-model fine-tuning under both full-data and few-shot settings. Our approach is effective and efficient for using large-scale PLMs in practice. The code is publicly available at https:// github.com/thu-coai/PPT.",,,
237453212,Smoothed Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Sentence Embedding,"Unsupervised contrastive sentence embedding models, e.g., unsupervised SimCSE, use the InfoNCE loss function in training. Theoretically, we expect to use larger batches to get more adequate comparisons among samples and avoid overfitting. However, increasing batch size leads to performance degradation when it exceeds a threshold, which is probably due to the introduction of false-negative pairs through statistical observation. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a simple smoothing strategy upon the InfoNCE loss function, termed Gaussian Smoothed InfoNCE (GS-InfoNCE). In other words, we add random Gaussian noise as an extension to the negative pairs without increasing the batch size. Through experiments on the semantic text similarity tasks, though simple, the proposed smoothing strategy brings improvements to unsupervised SimCSE. Our code are available at",,,
237454564,TimeTraveler: Reinforcement Learning for Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting,"Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning is a crucial task that has gained increasing research interest in recent years. Most existing methods focus on reasoning at past timestamps to complete the missing facts, and there are only a few works of reasoning on known TKGs to forecast future facts. Compared with the completion task, the forecasting task is more difficult and faces two main challenges:(1) how to effectively model the time information to handle future timestamps? (2) how to make inductive inference to handle previously unseen entities that emerge over time? To address these challenges, we propose the first reinforcement learning method for forecasting. Specifically, the agent travels on historical knowledge graph snapshots to search for the answer. Our method defines a relative time encoding function to capture the timespan information, and we design a novel time-shaped reward based on Dirichlet distribution to guide the model learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel representation method for unseen entities to improve the inductive inference ability of the model. We evaluate our method for this link prediction task at future timestamps. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvement meanwhile with higher explainability, less calculation, and fewer parameters when compared with existing stateof-the-art methods.",,,
237485334,Balancing Methods for Multi-label Text Classification with Long-Tailed Class Distribution,"Multi-label text classification is a challenging task because it requires capturing label dependencies. It becomes even more challenging when class distribution is long-tailed. Resampling and re-weighting are common approaches used for addressing the class imbalance problem, however, they are not effective when there is label dependency besides class imbalance because they result in oversampling of common labels. Here, we introduce the application of balancing loss functions for multilabel text classification. We perform experiments on a general domain dataset with 90 labels (Reuters-21578) and a domain-specific dataset from PubMed with 18211 labels. We find that a distribution-balanced loss function, which inherently addresses both the class imbalance and label linkage problems, outperforms commonly used loss functions. Distribution balancing methods have been successfully used in the image recognition field. Here, we show their effectiveness in natural language processing.

237490383,On Language Models for Creoles,"Creole languages such as Nigerian Pidgin English and Haitian Creole are under-resourced and largely ignored in the NLP literature. Creoles typically result from the fusion of a foreign language with multiple local languages, and what grammatical and lexical features are transferred to the creole is a complex process (Sessarego, 2020). While creoles are generally stable, the prominence of some features may be much stronger with certain demographics or in some linguistic situations(Winford, 1999;Patrick, 1999). This paper makes several contributions: We collect existing corpora and release models for Haitian Creole, Nigerian Pidgin English, and Singaporean Colloquial English. We evaluate these models on intrinsic and extrinsic tasks. Motivated by the above literature, we compare standard language models with distributionally robust ones and find that, somewhat surprisingly, the standard language models are superior to the distributionally robust ones. We investigate whether this is an effect of overparameterization or relative distributional stability, and find that the difference persists in the absence of over-parameterization, and that drift is limited, confirming the relative stability of creole languages.",,,
237492043,Exploring Task Difficulty for Few-Shot Relation Extraction,"Few-shot relation extraction (FSRE) focuses on recognizing novel relations by learning with merely a handful of annotated instances. Meta-learning has been widely adopted for such a task, which trains on randomly generated few-shot tasks to learn generic data representations. Despite impressive results achieved, existing models still perform suboptimally when handling hard FSRE tasks, where the relations are fine-grained and similar to each other. We argue this is largely because existing models do not distinguish hard tasks from easy ones in the learning process. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach based on contrastive learning that learns better representations by exploiting relation label information. We further design a method that allows the model to adaptively learn how to focus on hard tasks. Experiments on two standard datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",,,

To address this gap, we present YASO -a new TSA evaluation dataset of open-domain user reviews. YASO contains 2215 English sentences from dozens of review domains, annotated with target terms and their sentiment. Our analysis verifies the reliability of these annotations, and explores the characteristics of the collected data.

237507028,"Compression, Transduction, and Creation: A Unified Framework for Evaluating Natural Language Generation","Natural language generation (NLG) spans a broad range of tasks, each of which serves for specific objectives and desires different properties of generated text. The complexity makes automatic evaluation of NLG particularly challenging. Previous work has typically focused on a single task and developed individual evaluation metrics based on specific intuitions. In this paper, we propose a unifying perspective based on the nature of information change in NLG tasks, including compression (e.g., summarization), transduction (e.g., text rewriting), and creation (e.g., dialog). Information alignment between input, context, and output text plays a common central role in characterizing the generation. With automatic alignment prediction models, we develop a family of interpretable metrics that are suitable for evaluating key aspects of different NLG tasks, often without need of gold reference data. Experiments show the uniformly designed metrics achieve stronger or comparable correlations with human judgement compared to state-of-the-art metrics in each of diverse tasks, including text summarization, style transfer, and knowledgegrounded dialog. 1",,,
237513596,Unsupervised Keyphrase Extraction by Jointly Modeling Local and Global Context,"Embedding based methods are widely used for unsupervised keyphrase extraction (UKE) tasks. Generally, these methods simply calculate similarities between phrase embeddings and document embedding, which is insufficient to capture different context for a more effective UKE model. In this paper, we propose a novel method for UKE, where local and global contexts are jointly modeled. From a global view, we calculate the similarity between a certain phrase and the whole document in the vector space as transitional embedding based models do. In terms of the local view, we first build a graph structure based on the document where phrases are regarded as vertices and the edges are similarities between vertices. Then, we proposed a new centrality computation method to capture local salient information based on the graph structure. Finally, we further combine the modeling of global and local context for ranking. We evaluate our models on three public benchmarks (Inspec, DUC 2001, SemEval 2010 and compare with existing state-of-the-art models. The results show that our model outperforms most models while generalizing better on input documents with different domains and length. Additional ablation study shows that both the local and global information is crucial for unsupervised keyphrase extraction tasks.",,,
237532398,KnowMAN: Weakly Supervised Multinomial Adversarial Networks,"The absence of labeled data for training neural models is often addressed by leveraging knowledge about the specific task, resulting in heuristic but noisy labels. The knowledge is captured in labeling functions, which detect certain regularities or patterns in the training samples and annotate corresponding labels for training. This process of weakly supervised training may result in an over-reliance on the signals captured by the labeling functions and hinder models to exploit other signals or to generalize well. We propose KnowMAN, an adversarial scheme that enables to control influence of signals associated with specific labeling functions. KnowMAN forces the network to learn representations that are invariant to those signals and to pick up other signals that are more generally associated with an output label. KnowMAN strongly improves results compared to direct weakly supervised learning with a pre-trained transformer language model and a feature-based baseline.",,,
237532682,Scaling Laws for Neural Machine Translation,"We present an empirical study of scaling properties of encoder-decoder Transformer models used in neural machine translation (NMT). We show that cross-entropy loss as a function of model size follows a certain scaling law. Specifically (i) We propose a formula which describes the scaling behavior of cross-entropy loss as a bivariate function of encoder and decoder size, and show that it gives accurate predictions under a variety of scaling approaches and languages; we show that the total number of parameters alone is not sufficient for such purposes. (ii) We observe different power law exponents when scaling the decoder vs scaling the encoder, and provide recommendations for optimal allocation of encoder/decoder capacity based on this observation. (iii) We also report that the scaling behavior of the model is acutely influenced by composition bias of the train/test sets, which we define as any deviation from naturally generated text (either via machine generated or human translated text). We observe that natural text on the target side enjoys scaling, which manifests as successful reduction of the cross-entropy loss. (iv) Finally, we investigate the relationship between the cross-entropy loss and the quality of the generated translations. We find two different behaviors, depending on the nature of the test data. For test sets which were originally translated from target language to source language, both loss and BLEU score improve as model size increases. In contrast, for test sets originally translated from source language to target language, the loss improves, but the BLEU score stops improving after a certain threshold. We release generated text from all models used in this study.Preprint. Under review.",,,
237568724,Documenting Large Webtext Corpora: A Case Study on the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus,"Large language models have led to remarkable progress on many NLP tasks, and researchers are turning to ever-larger text corpora to train them. Some of the largest corpora available are made by scraping significant portions of the internet, and are frequently introduced with only minimal documentation. In this work we provide some of the first documentation for the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4; Raffel et al., 2020), a dataset created by applying a set of filters to a single snapshot of Common Crawl. We begin by investigating where the data came from, and find a significant amount of text from unexpected sources like patents and US military websites. Then we explore the content of the text itself, and find machine-generated text (e.g., from machine translation systems) and evaluation examples from other benchmark NLP datasets. To understand the impact of the filters applied to create this dataset, we evaluate the text that was removed, and show that blocklist filtering disproportionately removes text from and about minority individuals. Finally, we conclude with some recommendations for how to created and document web-scale datasets from a scrape of the internet.",,,
237571370,DuRecDial 2.0: A Bilingual Parallel Corpus for Conversational Recommendation,"In this paper, we provide a bilingual parallel human-to-human recommendation dialog dataset (DuRecDial 2.0) to enable researchers to explore a challenging task of multilingual and cross-lingual conversational recommendation. The difference between DuRecDial 2.0 and existing conversational recommendation datasets is that the data item (Profile, Goal, Knowledge, Context, Response) in DuRecDial 2.0 is annotated in two languages, both English and Chinese, while other datasets are built with the setting of a single language. We collect 8.2k dialogs aligned across English and Chinese languages (16.5k dialogs and 255k utterances in total) that are annotated by crowdsourced workers with strict quality control procedure. We then build monolingual, multilingual, and cross-lingual conversational recommendation baselines on DuRecDial 2.0. Experiment results show that the use of additional English data can bring performance improvement for Chinese conversational recommendation, indicating the benefits of DuRecDial 2.0. Finally, this dataset provides a challenging testbed for future studies of monolingual, multilingual, and cross-lingual conversational recommendation.",,,
237572264,Do Long-Range Language Models Actually Use Long-Range Context?,"Language models are generally trained on short, truncated input sequences, which limits their ability to use discourse-level information present in long-range context to improve their predictions. Recent efforts to improve the efficiency of self-attention have led to a proliferation of long-range Transformer language models, which can process much longer sequences than models of the past. However, the ways in which such models take advantage of the longrange context remain unclear. In this paper, we perform a fine-grained analysis of two longrange Transformer language models (including the Routing Transformer, which achieves state-of-the-art perplexity on the PG-19 longsequence LM benchmark dataset) that accept input sequences of up to 8K tokens. Our results reveal that providing long-range context (i.e., beyond the previous 2K tokens) to these models only improves their predictions on a small set of tokens (e.g., those that can be copied from the distant context) and does not help at all for sentence-level prediction tasks. Finally, we discover that PG-19 contains a variety of different document types and domains, and that long-range context helps most for literary novels (as opposed to textbooks or magazines).",,,
237581068,Condenser: a Pre-training Architecture for Dense Retrieval,"Pre-trained Transformer language models (LM) have become go-to text representation encoders. Prior research fine-tunes deep LMs to encode text sequences such as sentences and passages into single dense vector representations for efficient text comparison and retrieval. However, dense encoders require a lot of data and sophisticated techniques to effectively train and suffer in low data situations. This paper finds a key reason is that standard LMs' internal attention structure is not ready-to-use for dense encoders, which needs to aggregate text information into the dense representation. We propose to pre-train towards dense encoder with a novel Transformer architecture, Condenser, where LM prediction CONditions on DENSE Representation. Our experiments show Condenser improves over standard LM by large margins on various text retrieval and similarity tasks. 1",,,
237581476,CONVFIT: Conversational Fine-Tuning of Pretrained Language Models,"Transformer-based language models (LMs) pretrained on large text collections are proven to store a wealth of semantic knowledge. However, 1) they are not effective as sentence encoders when used off-the-shelf, and 2) thus typically lag behind conversationally pretrained (e.g., via response selection) encoders on conversational tasks such as intent detection (ID). In this work, we propose CON-VFIT, a simple and efficient two-stage procedure which turns any pretrained LM into a universal conversational encoder (after Stage 1 CONVFIT-ing) and task-specialised sentence encoder (after Stage 2). We demonstrate that 1) full-blown conversational pretraining is not required, and that LMs can be quickly transformed into effective conversational encoders with much smaller amounts of unannotated data; 2) pretrained LMs can be fine-tuned into task-specialised sentence encoders, optimised for the fine-grained semantics of a particular task. Consequently, such specialised sentence encoders allow for treating ID as a simple semantic similarity task based on interpretable nearest neighbours retrieval. We validate the robustness and versatility of the CON-VFIT framework with such similarity-based inference on the standard ID evaluation sets: CONVFIT-ed LMs achieve state-of-the-art ID performance across the board, with particular gains in the most challenging, few-shot setups.

Recently, dense retrieval also achieved state-of-the-art results in multi-hop QA, where aggregating information from multiple pieces of information and reasoning over them is required. Despite their success, dense retrieval methods are computationally intensive, requiring multiple GPUs to train. In this work, we introduce a hybrid (lexical and dense) retrieval approach that is highly competitive with the state-of-the-art dense retrieval models, while requiring substantially less computational resources. Additionally, we provide an in-depth evaluation of dense retrieval methods on limited computational resource settings, something that is missing from the current literature.",,,
237593027,Evaluating Debiasing Techniques for Intersectional Biases,"Bias is pervasive in NLP models, motivating the development of automatic debiasing techniques. Evaluation of NLP debiasing methods has largely been limited to binary attributes in isolation, e.g., debiasing with respect to binary gender or race, however many corpora involve multiple such attributes, possibly with higher cardinality. In this paper we argue that a truly fair model must consider 'gerrymandering' groups which comprise not only single attributes, but also intersectional groups. We evaluate a form of bias-constrained model which is new to NLP, as well an extension of the iterative nullspace projection technique which can handle multiple protected attributes.",,,
238198466,A FIRST-OCCUPANCY REPRESENTATION FOR REINFORCEMENT LEARNING,"Both animals and artificial agents benefit from state representations that support rapid transfer of learning across tasks and which enable them to efficiently traverse their environments to reach rewarding states. The successor representation (SR), which measures the expected cumulative, discounted state occupancy under a fixed policy, enables efficient transfer to different reward structures in an otherwise constant Markovian environment and has been hypothesized to underlie aspects of biological behavior and neural activity. However, in the real world, rewards may move or only be available for consumption once, may shift location, or agents may simply aim to reach goal states as rapidly as possible without the constraint of artificially imposed task horizons. In such cases, the most behaviorally-relevant representation would carry information about when the agent was likely to first reach states of interest, rather than how often it should expect to visit them over a potentially infinite time span. To reflect such demands, we introduce the firstoccupancy representation (FR), which measures the expected temporal discount to the first time a state is accessed. We demonstrate that the FR facilitates exploration, the selection of efficient paths to desired states, allows the agent, under certain conditions, to plan provably optimal trajectories defined by a sequence of subgoals, and induces similar behavior to animals avoiding threatening stimuli.",,,

Existing approaches to solve this problem take a two-step approach. First, they generate embedding representations for both noun and relation phrases, then a clustering algorithm is used to group them using the embeddings as features. In this work, we propose Canonicalizing Using Variational Autoencoders (CUVA) 1 , a joint model to learn both embeddings and cluster assignments in an end-to-end approach, which leads to a better vector representation for the noun and relation phrases. Our evaluation over multiple benchmarks shows that CUVA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we introduce CANONICNELL, a novel dataset to evaluate entity canonicalization systems.",,,
238215654,PAC-BAYES INFORMATION BOTTLENECK,"Understanding the source of the superior generalization ability of NNs remains one of the most important problems in ML research. There have been a series of theoretical works trying to derive non-vacuous bounds for NNs. Recently, the compression of information stored in weights (IIW) is proved to play a key role in NNs generalization based on the PAC-Bayes theorem. However, no solution of IIW has ever been provided, which builds a barrier for further investigation of the IIW's property and its potential in practical deep learning. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the efficient approximation of IIW. Then, we build an IIW-based information bottleneck on the trade-off between accuracy and information complexity of NNs, namely PIB. From PIB, we can empirically identify the fitting to compressing phase transition during NNs' training and the concrete connection between the IIW compression and the generalization. Besides, we verify that IIW is able to explain NNs in broad cases, e.g., varying batch sizes, overparameterization, and noisy labels. Moreover, we propose an MCMC-based algorithm to sample from the optimal weight posterior characterized by PIB, which fulfills the potential of IIW in enhancing NNs in practice. .

238259938,Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction as Paraphrase Generation *,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has been extensively studied in recent years, which typically involves four fundamental sentiment elements, including the aspect category, aspect term, opinion term, and sentiment polarity. Existing studies usually consider the detection of partial sentiment elements, instead of predicting the four elements in one shot. In this work, we introduce the Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction (ASQP) task, aiming to jointly detect all sentiment elements in quads for a given opinionated sentence, which can reveal a more comprehensive and complete aspect-level sentiment structure. We further propose a novel PARAPHRASE modeling paradigm to cast the ASQP task to a paraphrase generation process. On one hand, the generation formulation allows solving ASQP in an end-to-end manner, alleviating the potential error propagation in the pipeline solution. On the other hand, the semantics of the sentiment elements can be fully exploited by learning to generate them in the natural language form. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the superiority of our proposed method and the capacity of crosstask transfer with the proposed unified PARA-PHRASE modeling framework.",,,
238407774,EQUIVARIANT SUBGRAPH AGGREGATION NETWORKS,"Message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) are the leading architecture for deep learning on graph-structured data, in large part due to their simplicity and scalability. Unfortunately, it was shown that these architectures are limited in their expressive power. This paper proposes a novel framework called Equivariant Subgraph Aggregation Networks (ESAN) to address this issue. Our main observation is that while two graphs may not be distinguishable by an MPNN, they often contain distinguishable subgraphs. Thus, we propose to represent each graph as a set of subgraphs derived by some predefined policy, and to process it using a suitable equivariant architecture. We develop novel variants of the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test for graph isomorphism, and prove lower bounds on the expressiveness of ESAN in terms of these new WL variants. We further prove that our approach increases the expressive power of both MPNNs and more expressive architectures. Moreover, we provide theoretical results that describe how design choices such as the subgraph selection policy and equivariant neural architecture affect our architecture's expressive power. To deal with the increased computational cost, we propose a subgraph sampling scheme, which can be viewed as a stochastic version of our framework. A comprehensive set of experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrates that our framework improves the expressive power and overall performance of popular GNN architectures. * Equal contribution, authors are in alphabetical order.Figure 1: We present a provably expressive graph learning framework based on representing graphs as bags of subgraphs and processing them with an equivariant architecture composed of GNNs and set networks. Left: A pair of graphs not distinguishable by the WL test. Right: The corresponding bags (multisets) of edge-deleted subgraphs, which can be distinguished by our framework.Our approach. In an effort to devise simple, intuitive and more flexible provably expressive graph architectures, we develop a novel framework, dubbed Equivariant Subgraph Aggregation Networks (ESAN), to enhance the expressive power of existing GNNs. Our solution emerges from the observation that while two graphs may not be distinguishable by an MPNN, it may be easy to find distinguishable subgraphs. More generally, instead of encoding multisets of node colors as done in MPNNs and the WL test, we opt for encoding bags (multisets) of subgraphs and show that such an encoding can lead to a better expressive power. Following that observation, we advocate representing each graph as a bag of subgraphs chosen according to some predefined policy, e.g., all graphs that can be obtained by removing one edge from the original graph.Figure 1illustrates this idea.Bags of subgraphs are highly structured objects whose symmetry arises from both the structure of each constituent graph as well as the multiset on the whole. We propose an equivariant architecture specifically tailored to capture this object's symmetry group. Specifically, we first formulate the symmetry group for a set of graphs as the direct product of the symmetry groups for sets and graphs. We then construct a neural network comprising layers that are equivariant to this group. Motivated byMaron et al. (2020), these layers employ two base graph encoders as subroutines: The first encoder implements a Siamese network processing each subgraph independently; The second acts as an information sharing module by processing the aggregation of the subgraphs. After being processed by several such layers, a set learning module aggregates the obtained subgraph representations into an invariant representation of the original graph that is used in downstream tasks.An integral component of our method, with major impacts on its complexity and expressivity, is the subgraph selection policy: a function that maps a graph to a bag of subgraphs, which is then processed by our equivariant neural network. In this paper, we explore four simple -yet powerful -subgraph selection policies: node-deleted subgraphs, edge-deleted subgraphs, and two variants of ego-networks. To alleviate the possible computational burden, we also introduce an efficient stochastic version of our method implemented by random sampling of subgraphs according to the aforementioned policies.We provide a thorough theoretical analysis of our approach. We first prove that our architecture can implement novel and provably stronger variants of the well-known WL test, capable of encoding the multiset of subgraphs according to the base graph encoder (e.g., WL for MPNNs). Furthermore, we study how the expressive power of our architecture depends on different main design choices like the underlying base graph encoder or the subgraph selection policy. Notably, we prove that our framework can separate 3-WL indistinguishable graphs using only a 1-WL graph encoder, and that it can enhance the expressive power of stronger architectures such as PPGN (Maron et al., 2019a).We then present empirical results on a wide range of synthetic and real datasets, using several existing GNNs as base encoders. Firstly, we study the expressive power of our approach using the synthetic datasets introduced by Abboud et al.

238408001,VC DIMENSION OF PARTIALLY QUANTIZED NEURAL NETWORKS IN THE OVERPARAMETRIZED REGIME,"Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory has so far been unable to explain the small generalization error of overparametrized neural networks. Indeed, existing applications of VC theory to large networks obtain upper bounds on VC dimension that are proportional to the number of weights, and for a large class of networks, these upper bound are known to be tight. In this work, we focus on a class of partially quantized networks that we refer to as hyperplane arrangement neural networks (HANNs). Using a sample compression analysis, we show that HANNs can have VC dimension significantly smaller than the number of weights, while being highly expressive. In particular, empirical risk minimization over HANNs in the overparametrized regime achieves the minimax rate for classification with Lipschitz posterior class probability. We further demonstrate the expressivity of HANNs empirically. On a panel of 121 UCI datasets, overparametrized HANNs match the performance of state-of-the-art full-precision models.",,,
238408147,GRAPHON BASED CLUSTERING AND TESTING OF NET- WORKS: ALGORITHMS AND THEORY,"Network-valued data are encountered in a wide range of applications, and pose challenges in learning due to their complex structure and absence of vertex correspondence. Typical examples of such problems include classification or grouping of protein structures and social networks. Various methods, ranging from graph kernels to graph neural networks, have been proposed that achieve some success in graph classification problems. However, most methods have limited theoretical justification, and their applicability beyond classification remains unexplored. In this work, we propose methods for clustering multiple graphs, without vertex correspondence, that are inspired by the recent literature on estimating graphonssymmetric functions corresponding to infinite vertex limit of graphs. We propose a novel graph distance based on sorting-and-smoothing graphon estimators. Using the proposed graph distance, we present two clustering algorithms and show that they achieve state-of-the-art results. We prove the statistical consistency of both algorithms under Lipschitz assumptions on the graph degrees. We further study the applicability of the proposed distance for graph two-sample testing problems. arXiv:2110.02722v2 [cs.LG] 7 Nov 2021 work classification, and second is the lack of theoretical analysis of these methods, particularly in the small sample setting. Generalisation error bounds for graph kernel based learning exist(Du et al., 2019), but these bounds, based on learning theory, are meaningful only when many networks are available. However, in many applications, one needs to learn from a small population of large networks and, in such cases, an informative statistical analysis should consider the small sample, large graph regime. To address this issue, we take inspiration from the recent statistics literature on graph two-sample testing-given two (populations of) large graphs, the goal is to decide if they are from same statistical model or not. Although most theoretical studies in graph two-sample testing focus on graph with vertex correspondence (Tang et al.",,,
238408308,8-BIT OPTIMIZERS VIA BLOCK-WISE QUANTIZATION,"Stateful optimizers maintain gradient statistics over time, e.g., the exponentially smoothed sum (SGD with momentum) or squared sum (Adam) of past gradient values. This state can be used to accelerate optimization compared to plain stochastic gradient descent but uses memory that might otherwise be allocated to model parameters, thereby limiting the maximum size of models trained in practice. In this paper, we develop the first optimizers that use 8-bit statistics while maintaining the performance levels of using 32-bit optimizer states. To overcome the resulting computational, quantization, and stability challenges, we develop block-wise dynamic quantization. Block-wise quantization divides input tensors into smaller blocks that are independently quantized. Each block is processed in parallel across cores, yielding faster optimization and high precision quantization. To maintain stability and performance, we combine block-wise quantization with two additional changes: (1) dynamic quantization, a form of non-linear optimization that is precise for both large and small magnitude values, and (2) a stable embedding layer to reduce gradient variance that comes from the highly non-uniform distribution of input tokens in language models. As a result, our 8-bit optimizers maintain 32-bit performance with a small fraction of the memory footprint on a range of tasks, including 1.5B parameter language modeling, GLUE finetuning, ImageNet classification, WMT'14 machine translation, MoCo v2 contrastive ImageNet pretraining+finetuning, and RoBERTa pretraining, without changes to the original optimizer hyperparameters. We open-sourceour 8-bit optimizers as a drop-in replacement that only requires a two-line code change.Increasing model size is an effective way to achieve better performance for given resourcesHenighan et al., 2020;Raffel et al., 2019;Lewis et al., 2021). However, training such large models requires storing the model, gradient, and state of the optimizer (e.g., exponentially smoothed sum and squared sum of previous gradients for Adam), all in a fixed amount of available memory. Although significant research has focused on enabling larger model training by reducing or efficiently distributing the memory required for the model parameters(Shoeybi et al., 2019;Lepikhin et al., 2020;Fedus et al., 2021;Brown et al., 2020;Rajbhandari et al., 2020), reducing the memory footprint of optimizer gradient statistics is much less studied. This is a significant missed opportunity since these optimizer states use 33-75% of the total memory footprint during training. For example, the Adam optimizer states for the largest GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) and T5 (Raffel et al., 2019) models are 11 GB and 41 GB in size. In this paper, we develop a fast, high-precision non-linear quantization method -block-wise dynamic quantization -that enables stable 8-bit optimizers (e.g., Adam, AdamW, and Momentum) which maintain 32-bit performance at a fraction of the memory footprint and without any changes to the original hyperparameters. 1 While most current work uses 32-bit optimizer states, recent high-profile efforts to use 16-bit optimizers report difficultly for large models with more than 1B parameters(Ramesh et al., 2021). Going from 16-bit optimizers to 8-bit optimizers reduces the range of possible values from 2 16 = 65536 values to just 2 8 = 256. To our knowledge, this has not been attempted before.Effectively using this very limited range is challenging for three reasons: quantization accuracy, computational efficiency, and large-scale stability. To maintain accuracy, it is critical to introduce some form of non-linear quantization to reduce errors for both common small magnitude values 1  We study 8-bit optimization with current best practice model and gradient representations (typically 16-bit mixed precision), to isolate optimization challenges. Future work could explore further compressing all three.",,,
238408313,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 OBJECTS IN SEMANTIC TOPOLOGY,"A more realistic object detection paradigm, Open-World Object Detection, has arised increasing research interests in the community recently. A qualified openworld object detector can not only identify objects of known categories, but also discover unknown objects, and incrementally learn to categorize them when their annotations progressively arrive. Previous works rely on independent modules to recognize unknown categories and perform incremental learning, respectively. In this paper, we provide a unified perspective: Semantic Topology. During the life-long learning of an open-world object detector, all object instances from the same category are assigned to their corresponding pre-defined node in the semantic topology, including the 'unknown' category. This constraint builds up discriminative feature representations and consistent relationships among objects, thus enabling the detector to distinguish unknown objects out of the known categories, as well as making learned features of known objects undistorted when learning new categories incrementally. Extensive experiments demonstrate that semantic topology, either randomly-generated or derived from a well-trained language model, could outperform the current state-of-the-art open-world object detectors by a large margin, e.g., the absolute open-set error (the number of unknown instances that are wrongly labeled as known) is reduced from 7832 to 2546, exhibiting the inherent superiority of semantic topology on open-world object detection.",,,
238408406,ON THE IMPORTANCE OF FIRTH BIAS REDUCTION IN FEW-SHOT CLASSIFICATION,"Learning accurate classifiers for novel categories from very few examples, known as few-shot image classification, is a challenging task in statistical machine learning and computer vision. The performance in few-shot classification suffers from the bias in the estimation of classifier parameters; however, an effective underlying bias reduction technique that could alleviate this issue in training few-shot classifiers has been overlooked. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Firth bias reduction in few-shot classification. Theoretically, Firth bias reduction removes the O(N −1 ) first order term from the small-sample bias of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator. Here we show that the general Firth bias reduction technique simplifies to encouraging uniform class assignment probabilities for multinomial logistic classification, and almost has the same effect in cosine classifiers. We derive an easy-to-implement optimization objective for Firth penalized multinomial logistic and cosine classifiers, which is equivalent to penalizing the cross-entropy loss with a KL-divergence between the uniform label distribution and the predictions. Then, we empirically evaluate that it is consistently effective across the board for few-shot image classification, regardless of (1) the feature representations from different backbones, (2) the number of samples per class, and (3) the number of classes. Finally, we show the robustness of Firth bias reduction, in the case of imbalanced data distribution. Our implementation is available at",,,
238419359,GNN IS A COUNTER? REVISITING GNN FOR QUESTION ANSWERING,"Question Answering (QA) has been a long-standing research topic in AI and NLP fields, and a wealth of studies have been conducted to attempt to equip QA systems with human-level reasoning capability. To approximate the complicated human reasoning process, state-of-the-art QA systems commonly use pre-trained language models (LMs) to access knowledge encoded in LMs together with elaborately designed modules based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to perform reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs). However, many problems remain open regarding the reasoning functionality of these GNN-based modules. Can these GNN-based modules really perform a complex reasoning process? Are they under-or overcomplicated for QA? To open the black box of GNN and investigate these problems, we dissect state-of-the-art GNN modules for QA and analyze their reasoning capability. We discover that even a very simple graph neural counter can outperform all the existing GNN modules on CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA, two popular QA benchmark datasets which heavily rely on knowledge-aware reasoning. Our work reveals that existing knowledge-aware GNN modules may only carry out some simple reasoning such as counting. It remains a challenging open problem to build comprehensive reasoning modules for knowledge-powered QA. * Work done during an internship at MSRA",,,
238419702,SELF-SUPERVISED INFERENCE IN STATE-SPACE MOD- ELS,"We perform approximate inference in state-space models with nonlinear state transitions. Without parameterizing a generative model, we apply Bayesian update formulas using a local linearity approximation parameterized by neural networks. This comes accompanied by a maximum likelihood objective that requires no supervision via uncorrupt observations or ground truth latent states. The optimization backpropagates through a recursion similar to the classical Kalman filter and smoother. Additionally, using an approximate conditional independence, we can perform smoothing without having to parameterize a separate model. In scientific applications, domain knowledge can give a linear approximation of the latent transition maps, which we can easily incorporate into our model. Usage of such domain knowledge is reflected in excellent results (despite our model's simplicity) on the chaotic Lorenz system compared to fully supervised and variational inference methods. Finally, we show competitive results on an audio denoising experiment.",,,
238582721,Frequency-aware SGD for Efficient Embedding Learning with Provable Benefits,"Embedding learning has found widespread applications in recommendation systems and natural language modeling, among other domains. To learn quality embeddings efficiently, adaptive learning rate algorithms have demonstrated superior empirical performance over SGD, largely accredited to their token-dependent learning rate. However, the underlying mechanism for the efficiency of token-dependent learning rate remains underexplored. We show that incorporating frequency information of tokens in the embedding learning problems leads to provably efficient algorithms, and demonstrate that common adaptive algorithms implicitly exploit the frequency information to a large extent. Specifically, we propose (Counterbased) Frequency-aware Stochastic Gradient Descent, which applies a frequency-dependent learning rate for each token, and exhibits provable speed-up compared to SGD when the token distribution is imbalanced. Empirically, we show the proposed algorithms are able to improve or match adaptive algorithms on benchmark recommendation tasks and a large-scale industrial recommendation system, closing the performance gap between SGD and adaptive algorithms, while using significantly lower memory. Our results are the first to show token-dependent learning rate provably improves convergence for non-convex embedding learning problems. * Work done while an intern at Facebook.

There has been a fruitful line of research on analyzing the convergence of adaptive learning rate algorithms in non-convex setting. These results aim to match the convergence rate of standard SGD given by O(1/ √ T) (Ghadimi and Lan, 2013), however often with additional factor of log T (Ward et al., 2018; Défossez et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2018; Reddi et al., 2018), or with worse dimension dependence (Zhou et al., 2018a) for smooth problem (assumed byalmost all prior works). Moreover, all existing works aim to analyze the convergence for general non-convex problems, ignoring unique data features in embedding learning problems, where adaptive algorithms are most successful. We explicitly take account into the sparsity of stochastic gradient, and token distribution imbalancedness into the design and analysis of our proposed algorithms, which are the keys to better convergence properties. Adaptive algorithms and SGD. To the best of our knowledge, the study on understanding why adaptive learning rate algorithms outperform SGD is very limited. Zhang et al. (2019)  argue that BERT pretraining (Devlin et al., 2018)  has heavy-tailed noise, implying unbounded variance and possible non-convergence of SGD. Normalized gradient clipping method is proposed therein and converges for a family of heavy-tailed noise distributions. Our results focus on a different direction by showing that imbalanced token distribution is an important factor that can be leveraged to design more efficient algorithms for embedding learning problems. Our result also does not rely on the noise to be heavy-tailed for the convergence benefits of the proposed FA/CF-SGD to take effect.

238583011,Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 ROBUST AND SCALABLE SDE LEARNING: A FUNCTIONAL PERSPECTIVE,"Stochastic differential equations provide a rich class of flexible generative models, capable of describing a wide range of spatio-temporal processes. A host of recent work looks to learn data-representing SDEs, using neural networks and other flexible function approximators. Despite these advances, learning remains computationally expensive due to the sequential nature of SDE integrators. In this work, we propose an importance-sampling estimator for probabilities of observations of SDEs for the purposes of learning. Crucially, the approach we suggest does not rely on such integrators. The proposed method produces lower-variance gradient estimates compared to algorithms based on SDE integrators and has the added advantage of being embarrassingly parallelizable. This facilitates the effective use of large-scale parallel hardware for massive decreases in computation time.",,,
238583252,PHASE COLLAPSE IN NEURAL NETWORKS,"Deep convolutional classifiers linearly separate image classes and improve accuracy as depth increases. They progressively reduce the spatial dimension whereas the number of channels grows with depth. Spatial variability is therefore transformed into variability along channels. A fundamental challenge is to understand the role of non-linearities together with convolutional filters in this transformation. ReLUs with biases are often interpreted as thresholding operators that improve discrimination through sparsity. This paper demonstrates that it is a different mechanism called phase collapse which eliminates spatial variability while linearly separating classes. We show that collapsing the phases of complex wavelet coefficients is sufficient to reach the classification accuracy of ResNets of similar depths. However, replacing the phase collapses with thresholding operators that enforce sparsity considerably degrades the performance. We explain these numerical results by showing that the iteration of phase collapses progressively improves separation of classes, as opposed to thresholding non-linearities.",,,
238634584,CRYSTAL DIFFUSION VARIATIONAL AUTOENCODER FOR PERIODIC MATERIAL GENERATION,"Generating the periodic structure of stable materials is a long-standing challenge for the material design community. This task is difficult because stable materials only exist in a low-dimensional subspace of all possible periodic arrangements of atoms: 1) the coordinates must lie in the local energy minimum defined by quantum mechanics, and 2) global stability also requires the structure to follow the complex, yet specific bonding preferences between different atom types. Existing methods fail to incorporate these factors and often lack proper invariances. We propose a Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE) that captures the physical inductive bias of material stability. By learning from the data distribution of stable materials, the decoder generates materials in a diffusion process that moves atomic coordinates towards a lower energy state and updates atom types to satisfy bonding preferences between neighbors. Our model also explicitly encodes interactions across periodic boundaries and respects permutation, translation, rotation, and periodic invariances. We significantly outperform past methods in three tasks: 1) reconstructing the input structure, 2) generating valid, diverse, and realistic materials, and 3) generating materials that optimize a specific property. We also provide several standard datasets and evaluation metrics for the broader machine learning community. 1",,,
238634705,On Releasing Annotator-Level Labels and Information in Datasets,"A common practice in building NLP datasets, especially using crowd-sourced annotations, involves obtaining multiple annotator judgements on the same data instances, which are then flattened to produce a single ""ground truth"" label or score, through majority voting, averaging, or adjudication. While these approaches may be appropriate in certain annotation tasks, such aggregations overlook the socially constructed nature of human perceptions that annotations for relatively more subjective tasks are meant to capture. In particular, systematic disagreements between annotators owing to their socio-cultural backgrounds and/or lived experiences are often obfuscated through such aggregations. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that label aggregation may introduce representational biases of individual and group perspectives. Based on this finding, we propose a set of recommendations for increased utility and transparency of datasets for downstream use cases.",,,
238634750,Dealing with Disagreements: Looking Beyond the Majority Vote in Subjective Annotations,"Majority voting and averaging are common approaches used to resolve annotator disagreements and derive single ground truth labels from multiple annotations. However, annotators may systematically disagree with one another, often reflecting their individual biases and values, especially in the case of subjective tasks such as detecting affect, aggression, and hate speech. Annotator disagreements may capture important nuances in such tasks that are often ignored while aggregating annotations to a single ground truth. In order to address this, we investigate the efficacy of multi-annotator models. In particular, our multi-task based approach treats predicting each annotators' judgements as separate subtasks, while sharing a common learned representation of the task. We show that this approach yields same or better performance than aggregating labels in the data prior to training across seven different binary classification tasks. Our approach also provides a way to estimate uncertainty in predictions, which we demonstrate better correlate with annotation disagreements than traditional methods. Being able to model uncertainty is especially useful in deployment scenarios where knowing when not to make a prediction is important.92",,,
238634783,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 TADA! TEMPORALLY-ADAPTIVE CONVOLUTIONS FOR VIDEO UNDERSTANDING,"Spatial convolutions 1 are widely used in numerous deep video models. It fundamentally assumes spatio-temporal invariance, i.e., using shared weights for every location in different frames. This work presents Temporally-Adaptive Convolutions (TAdaConv) for video understanding 2 , which shows that adaptive weight calibration along the temporal dimension is an efficient way to facilitate modelling complex temporal dynamics in videos. Specifically, TAdaConv empowers the spatial convolutions with temporal modelling abilities by calibrating the convolution weights for each frame according to its local and global temporal context. Compared to previous temporal modelling operations, TAdaConv is more efficient as it operates over the convolution kernels instead of the features, whose dimension is an order of magnitude smaller than the spatial resolutions. Further, the kernel calibration brings an increased model capacity. We construct TAda2D and TAda-ConvNeXt networks by replacing the 2D convolutions in ResNet and ConvNeXt with TAdaConv, which leads to at least on par or better performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches on multiple video action recognition and localization benchmarks. We also demonstrate that as a readily plug-in operation with negligible computation overhead, TAdaConv can effectively improve many existing video models with a convincing margin.",,,
238856707,"Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 BUNDLE NETWORKS: FIBER BUNDLES, LOCAL TRIV- IALIZATIONS, AND A GENERATIVE APPROACH TO EX- PLORING MANY-TO-ONE MAPS","Many-to-one maps are ubiquitous in machine learning, from the image recognition model that assigns a multitude of distinct images to the concept of ""cat"" to the time series forecasting model which assigns a range of distinct time-series to a single scalar regression value. While the primary use of such models is naturally to associate correct output to each input, in many problems it is also useful to be able to explore, understand, and sample from a model's fibers, which are the set of input values x such that f (x) = y, for fixed y in the output space. In this paper we show that popular generative architectures are ill-suited to such tasks. Motivated by this we introduce a novel generative architecture, a Bundle Network, based on the concept of a fiber bundle from (differential) topology. BundleNets exploit the idea of a local trivialization wherein a space can be locally decomposed into a product space that cleanly encodes the many-to-one nature of the map. By enforcing this decomposition in BundleNets and by utilizing state-of-the-art invertible components, investigating a network's fibers becomes natural.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 is the ground truth pairing between input space X and output space Y , this amounts to calculating the inverse image π −1 (y), or fiber of π at y.Our goal in the present work is to (1) formalize this problem and (2) describe a deep learning framework which readily enables this kind of analysis. We take as our inspiration the notion of a fiber bundle from topology(Seifert, 1933;Whitney, 1935). Consider the projection map on X = Y × Z, π : Y × Z → Y , which sends π(y, z) = y. For any y ∈ Y , the inverse image π −1 (y) is easily calculated as {y} × Z ∼ = Z. Interpreted in terms of the machine learning task, Y is the component of X that we want to predict and Z encodes the remaining variation occurring among all x that map to y. Unfortunately, in our nonlinear world data distributions can rarely be decomposed into a product space on a global level like this. Instead, it is more realistic to hope that for each sufficiently small neighborhood U of Y , we can find a data distribution preserving homeomorphism U × Z ∼",,,

The SpeechT5 framework consists of a shared encoder-decoder network and six modal-specific (speech/text) pre/post-nets. After preprocessing the input speech/text through the pre-nets, the shared encoder-decoder network models the sequence-to-sequence transformation, and then the post-nets generate the output in the speech/text modality based on the output of the decoder. Leveraging large-scale unlabeled speech and text data, we pre-train SpeechT5 to learn a unified-modal representation, hoping to improve the modeling capability for both speech and text. To align the textual and speech information into this unified semantic space, we propose a cross-modal vector quantization approach that randomly mixes up speech/text states with latent units as the interface between encoder and decoder. Extensive evaluations show the superiority of the proposed SpeechT5 framework on a wide variety of spoken language processing tasks, including automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, voice conversion, speech enhancement, and speaker identification.

238856938,Retrieval-guided Counterfactual Generation for QA,"Deep NLP models have been shown to be brittle to input perturbations. Recent work has shown that data augmentation using counterfactuals -i.e. minimally perturbed inputscan help ameliorate this weakness. We focus on the task of creating counterfactuals for question answering, which presents unique challenges related to world knowledge, semantic diversity, and answerability. To address these challenges, we develop a Retrieve-Generate-Filter (RGF) technique to create counterfactual evaluation and training data with minimal human supervision. Using an open-domain QA framework and question generation model trained on original task data, we create counterfactuals that are fluent, semantically diverse, and automatically labeled. Data augmentation with RGF counterfactuals improves performance on out-of-domain and challenging evaluation sets over and above existing methods, in both the reading comprehension and open-domain QA settings. Moreover, we find that RGF data leads to significant improvements to robustness to local perturbations. 1",,,
238857129,WHY PROPAGATE ALONE? PARALLEL USE OF LABELS AND FEATURES ON GRAPHS,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) and label propagation represent two interrelated modeling strategies designed to exploit graph structure in tasks such as node property prediction. The former is typically based on stacked message-passing layers that share neighborhood information to transform node features into predictive embeddings. In contrast, the latter involves spreading label information to unlabeled nodes via a parameter-free diffusion process, but operates independently of the node features. Given then that the material difference is merely whether features or labels are smoothed across the graph, it is natural to consider combinations of the two for improving performance. In this regard, it has recently been proposed to use a randomly-selected portion of the training labels as GNN inputs, concatenated with the original node features for making predictions on the remaining labels. This so-called label trick accommodates the parallel use of features and labels, and is foundational to many of the top-ranking submissions on the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) leaderboard. And yet despite its wide-spread adoption, thus far there has been little attempt to carefully unpack exactly what statistical properties the label trick introduces into the training pipeline, intended or otherwise. To this end, we prove that under certain simplifying assumptions, the stochastic label trick can be reduced to an interpretable, deterministic training objective composed of two factors. The first is a data-fitting term that naturally resolves potential label leakage issues, while the second serves as a regularization factor conditioned on graph structure that adapts to graph size and connectivity. Later, we leverage this perspective to motivate a broader range of label trick use cases, and provide experiments to verify the efficacy of these extensions.",,,
238857301,UNIPELT: A Unified Framework for Parameter-Efficient Language Model Tuning,"Recent parameter-efficient language model tuning (PELT) methods manage to match the performance of fine-tuning with much fewer trainable parameters and perform especially well when training data is limited. However, different PELT methods may perform rather differently on the same task, making it nontrivial to select the most appropriate method for a specific task, especially considering the fast-growing number of new PELT methods and tasks. In light of model diversity and the difficulty of model selection, we propose a unified framework, UNIPELT, which incorporates different PELT methods as submodules and learns to activate the ones that best suit the current data or task setup via gating mechanism. On the GLUE benchmark, UNIPELT consistently achieves 1~4% gains compared to the best individual PELT method that it incorporates and outperforms fine-tuning under different setups. Moreover, UNIPELT generally surpasses the upper bound that takes the best performance of all its submodules used individually on each task, indicating that a mixture of multiple PELT methods may be inherently more effective than single methods.",,,
239009452,SOUND AND COMPLETE NEURAL NETWORK REPAIR WITH MINIMALITY AND LOCALITY GUARANTEES,"We present a novel methodology for repairing neural networks that use ReLU activation functions. Unlike existing methods that rely on modifying the weights of a neural network which can induce a global change in the function space, our approach applies only a localized change in the function space while still guaranteeing the removal of the buggy behavior. By leveraging the piecewise linear nature of ReLU networks, our approach can efficiently construct a patch network tailored to the linear region where the buggy input resides, which when combined with the original network, provably corrects the behavior on the buggy input. Our method is both sound and complete -the repaired network is guaranteed to fix the buggy input, and a patch is guaranteed to be found for any buggy input. Moreover, our approach preserves the continuous piecewise linear nature of ReLU networks, automatically generalizes the repair to all the points including other undetected buggy inputs inside the repair region, is minimal in terms of changes in the function space, and guarantees that outputs on inputs away from the repair region are unaltered. On several benchmarks, we show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of locality and limiting negative side effects.

[2020]proposes to minimize a loss defined based on the buggy inputs.Goldberger et al. [2020]uses an SMT solver to identify minimal weight changes to the output layer of the network so that the undesirable behaviors are removed. In general, the optimization-based approach cannot guarantee removal of the buggy behaviors, and the verification-based approach does not scale beyond networks of a few hundred neurons. In addition, both approaches suffer from substantial accuracy drops on normal inputs since weight changes may be a poor proxy for changes in the function space.3. Architecture extension. The third category of approaches extends the given NN architecture, such as by introducing more weight parameters, to facilitate more efficient repairs. The so-called Decoupled DNN architecture Sotoudeh and Thakur [2021]  is the only work we know that falls into this category. Their idea is to decouple the activations of the network from values of the network by augmenting the original network. Their construction allows the formulation of any single-layer repair as an linear programming (LP) problem. The decoupling, however, causes the repaired network to become discontinuous (in the functional sense). In addition, it still cannot isolate the output change to a single buggy input from the rest of the inputs.",,,
239009871,Sparks: Inspiration for Science Writing using Language Models,"Large-scale language models are rapidly improving, performing well on a variety of tasks with little to no customization. In this work we investigate how language models can support science writing, a challenging writing task that is both open-ended and highly constrained. We present a system for generating ""sparks"", sentences related to a scientific concept intended to inspire writers. We run a user study with 13 STEM graduate students and find three main use cases of sparks-inspiration, translation, and perspective-each of which correlates with a unique interaction pattern. We also find that while participants were more likely to select higher quality sparks, the overall quality of sparks seen by a given participant did not correlate with their satisfaction with the tool. 1",,,
239010011,BBQ: A Hand-Built Bias Benchmark for Question Answering,"It is well documented that NLP models learn social biases, but little work has been done on how these biases manifest in model outputs for applied tasks like question answering (QA). We introduce the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ), a dataset of question sets constructed by the authors that highlight attested social biases against people belonging to protected classes along nine social dimensions relevant for U.S. English-speaking contexts. Our task evaluates model responses at two levels: (i) given an under-informative context, we test how strongly responses refect social biases, and (ii) given an adequately informative context, we test whether the model's biases override a correct answer choice. We fnd that models often rely on stereotypes when the context is under-informative, meaning the model's outputs consistently reproduce harmful biases in this setting. Though models are more accurate when the context provides an informative answer, they still rely on stereotypes and average up to 3.4 percentage points higher accuracy when the correct answer aligns with a social bias than when it conficts, with this difference widening to over 5 points on examples targeting gender for most models tested.",,,
239016143,ONLINE TARGET Q-LEARNING WITH REVERSE EXPE- RIENCE REPLAY: EFFICIENTLY FINDING THE OPTIMAL POLICY FOR LINEAR MDPS,"Q-learning is a popular Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm which is widely used in practice with function approximation (Mnih et al., 2015). In contrast, existing theoretical results are pessimistic about Q-learning. For example, (Baird,  1995)  shows that Q-learning does not converge even with linear function approximation for linear MDPs. Furthermore, even for tabular MDPs with synchronous updates, Q-learning was shown to have sub-optimal sample complexity (Li et al.,  2021; Azar et al., 2013). The goal of this work is to bridge the gap between practical success of Q-learning and the relatively pessimistic theoretical results. The starting point of our work is the observation that in practice, Q-learning is used with two important modifications: (i) training with two networks, called online network and target network simultaneously (online target learning, or OTL) , and (ii) experience replay (ER) (Mnih et al., 2015). While they have been observed to play a significant role in the practical success of Q-learning, a thorough theoretical understanding of how these two modifications improve the convergence behavior of Q-learning has been missing in literature. By carefully combining Q-learning with OTL and reverse experience replay (RER) (a form of experience replay), we present novel methods Q-Rex and Q-RexDaRe (Q-Rex+ data reuse). We show that Q-Rex efficiently finds the optimal policy for linear MDPs (or more generally for MDPs with zero inherent Bellman error with linear approximation (ZIBEL)) and provide non-asymptotic bounds on sample complexity -the first such result for a Q-learning method for this class of MDPs under standard assumptions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Q-RexDaRe in fact achieves near optimal sample complexity in the tabular setting, improving upon the existing results for vanilla Q-learning.",,,
239016615,TRIGGER HUNTING WITH A TOPOLOGICAL PRIOR FOR TROJAN DETECTION,"Despite their success and popularity, deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable when facing backdoor attacks. This impedes their wider adoption, especially in mission critical applications. This paper tackles the problem of Trojan detection, namely, identifying Trojaned models -models trained with poisoned data. One popular approach is reverse engineering, i.e., recovering the triggers on a clean image by manipulating the model's prediction. One major challenge of reverse engineering approach is the enormous search space of triggers. To this end, we propose innovative priors such as diversity and topological simplicity to not only increase the chances of finding the appropriate triggers but also improve the quality of the found triggers. Moreover, by encouraging a diverse set of trigger candidates, our method can perform effectively in cases with unknown target labels. We demonstrate that these priors can significantly improve the quality of the recovered triggers, resulting in substantially improved Trojan detection accuracy as validated on both synthetic and publicly available TrojAI benchmarks.",,,
239049633,Actor-critic is implicitly biased towards high entropy optimal policies,"We show that the simplest actor-critic method -a linear softmax policy updated with TD through interaction with a linear MDP, but featuring no explicit regularization or explorationdoes not merely find an optimal policy, but moreover prefers high entropy optimal policies. To demonstrate the strength of this bias, the algorithm not only has no regularization, no projections, and no exploration like ǫ-greedy, but is moreover trained on a single trajectory with no resets. The key consequence of the high entropy bias is that uniform mixing assumptions on the MDP, which exist in some form in all prior work, can be dropped: the implicit regularization of the high entropy bias is enough to ensure that all chains mix and an optimal policy is reached with high probability. As auxiliary contributions, this work decouples concerns between the actor and critic by writing the actor update as an explicit mirror descent, provides tools to uniformly bound mixing times within KL balls of policy space, and provides a projection-free TD analysis with its own implicit bias which can be run from an unmixed starting distribution. .

239885913,Assessing the Sufficiency of Arguments through Conclusion Generation,"The premises of an argument give evidence or other reasons to support a conclusion. However, the amount of support required depends on the generality of a conclusion, the nature of the individual premises, and similar. An argument whose premises make its conclusion rationally worthy to be drawn is called sufficient in argument quality research. Previous work tackled sufficiency assessment as a standard text classification problem, not modeling the inherent relation of premises and conclusion. In this paper, we hypothesize that the conclusion of a sufficient argument can be generated from its premises. To study this hypothesis, we explore the potential of assessing sufficiency based on the output of large-scale pre-trained language models. Our best model variant achieves an F 1 -score of .885, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art and being on par with human experts. While manual evaluation reveals the quality of the generated conclusions, their impact remains low ultimately.",,,
240070335,TRAIL: NEAR-OPTIMAL IMITATION LEARNING WITH SUBOPTIMAL DATA,"The aim in imitation learning is to learn effective policies by utilizing near-optimal expert demonstrations. However, high-quality demonstrations from human experts can be expensive to obtain in large number. On the other hand, it is often much easier to obtain large quantities of suboptimal or task-agnostic trajectories, which are not useful for direct imitation, but can nevertheless provide insight into the dynamical structure of the environment, showing what could be done in the environment even if not what should be done. We ask the question, is it possible to utilize such suboptimal offline datasets to facilitate provably improved downstream imitation learning? In this work, we answer this question affirmatively and present training objectives that use offline datasets to learn a factored transition model whose structure enables the extraction of a latent action space. Our theoretical analysis shows that the learned latent action space can boost the sample-efficiency of downstream imitation learning, effectively reducing the need for large near-optimal expert datasets through the use of auxiliary non-expert data. To learn the latent action space in practice, we propose TRAIL (Transition-Reparametrized Actions for Imitation Learning), an algorithm that learns an energy-based transition model contrastively, and uses the transition model to reparametrize the action space for sample-efficient imitation learning. We evaluate the practicality of our objective through experiments on a set of navigation and locomotion tasks. Our results verify the benefits suggested by our theory and show that TRAIL is able to improve baseline imitation learning by up to 4x in performance. 1",,,
240288892,MentalBERT: Publicly Available Pretrained Language Models for Mental Healthcare,"Mental health is a critical issue in modern society, and mental disorders could sometimes turn to suicidal ideation without adequate treatment. Early detection of mental disorders and suicidal ideation from social content provides a potential way for effective social intervention. Recent advances in pretrained contextualized language representations have promoted the development of several domain-specific pretrained models and facilitated several downstream applications. However, there are no existing pretrained language models for mental healthcare. This paper trains and releases two pretrained masked language models, i.e., MentalBERT and MentalRoBERTa, to benefit machine learning for the mental healthcare research community. Besides, we evaluate our trained domain-specific models and several variants of pretrained language models on several mental disorder detection benchmarks and demonstrate that language representations pretrained in the target domain improve the performance of mental health detection tasks.",,,

241033259,OpenPrompt: An Open-source Framework for Prompt-learning,"Prompt-learning has become a new paradigm in modern natural language processing, which directly adapts pre-trained language models (PLMs) to cloze-style prediction, autoregressive modeling, or sequence to sequence generation, resulting in promising performances on various tasks. However, no standard implementation framework of prompt-learning is proposed yet, and most existing promptlearning codebases, often unregulated, only provide limited implementations for specific scenarios. Since there are many details such as templating strategy, initializing strategy, and verbalizing strategy, etc., need to be considered in prompt-learning, practitioners face impediments to quickly adapting the desired prompt learning methods to their applications. In this paper, we present Open-Prompt, a unified easy-to-use toolkit to conduct prompt-learning over PLMs.Open-Prompt is a research-friendly framework that is equipped with efficiency, modularity, and extendibility, and its combinability allows the freedom to combine different PLMs, task formats, and prompting modules in a unified paradigm. Users could expediently deploy prompt-learning frameworks and evaluate the generalization of them on different NLP tasks without constraints. 1",,,
241583548,Explainable Unsupervised Argument Similarity Rating with Abstract Meaning Representation and Conclusion Generation,"When assessing the similarity of arguments, researchers typically use approaches that do not provide interpretable evidence or justifications for their ratings. Hence, the features that determine argument similarity remain elusive. We address this issue by introducing novel argument similarity metrics that aim at high performance and explainability. We show that Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs can be useful for representing arguments, and that novel AMR graph metrics can offer explanations for argument similarity ratings. We start from the hypothesis that similar premises often lead to similar conclusionsand extend an approach for AMR-based argument similarity rating by estimating, in addition, the similarity of conclusions that we automatically infer from the arguments used as premises. We show that AMR similarity metrics make argument similarity judgements more interpretable and may even support argument quality judgements. Our approach provides significant performance improvements over strong baselines in a fully unsupervised setting. Finally, we make first steps to address the problem of reference-less evaluation of argumentative conclusion generations.",,,
243756979,LARGE-SCALE REPRESENTATION LEARNING ON GRAPHS VIA BOOTSTRAPPING,"Self-supervised learning provides a promising path towards eliminating the need for costly label information in representation learning on graphs. However, to achieve state-of-the-art performance, methods often need large numbers of negative examples and rely on complex augmentations. This can be prohibitively expensive, especially for large graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce Bootstrapped Graph Latents (BGRL) -a graph representation learning method that learns by predicting alternative augmentations of the input. BGRL uses only simple augmentations and alleviates the need for contrasting with negative examples, and is thus scalable by design. BGRL outperforms or matches prior methods on several established benchmarks, while achieving a 2-10x reduction in memory costs. Furthermore, we show that BGRL can be scaled up to extremely large graphs with hundreds of millions of nodes in the semi-supervised regime -achieving state-ofthe-art performance and improving over supervised baselines where representations are shaped only through label information. In particular, our solution centered on BGRL constituted one of the winning entries to the Open Graph Benchmark -Large Scale Challenge at KDD Cup 2021, on a graph orders of magnitudes larger than all previously available benchmarks, thus demonstrating the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.",,,
243865296,Cross-lingual Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis with Aspect Term Code-Switching *,"Many efforts have been made in solving the Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) task. While most existing studies focus on English texts, handling ABSA in resource-poor languages remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we consider the unsupervised crosslingual transfer for the ABSA task, where only labeled data in the source language is available and we aim at transferring its knowledge to the target language having no labeled data. To this end, we propose an alignment-free label projection method to obtain high-quality pseudolabeled data of the target language with the help of the translation system, which could preserve more accurate task-specific knowledge in the target language. For better utilizing the source and translated data, as well as enhancing the cross-lingual alignment, we design an aspect code-switching mechanism to augment the training data with code-switched bilingual sentences. To further investigate the importance of language-specific knowledge in solving the ABSA problem, we distill the above model on the unlabeled target language data which improves the performance to the same level of the supervised method.",,,
243865395,Cross Attention Augmented Transducer Networks for Simultaneous Translation,"This paper proposes a novel architecture, Cross Attention Augmented Transducer (CAAT), for simultaneous translation. The framework aims to jointly optimize the policy and translation models. To effectively consider all possible READ-WRITE simultaneous translation action paths, we adapt the online automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, RNN-T, but remove the strong monotonic constraint, which is critical for the translation task to consider reordering. To make CAAT work, we introduce a novel latency loss whose expectation can be optimized by a forward-backward algorithm. We implement CAAT with Transformer while the general CAAT architecture can also be implemented with other attention-based encoder-decoder frameworks. Experiments on both speech-to-text (S2T) and text-to-text (T2T) simultaneous translation tasks show that CAAT achieves significantly better latency-quality trade-offs compared to the state-of-the-art simultaneous translation approaches. 1",,,

However, there is still a paucity of vulnerability analyses of cross-lingual entity alignment under adversarial attacks. This paper proposes an adversarial attack model with two novel attack techniques to perturb the KG structure and degrade the quality of deep cross-lingual entity alignment. First, an entity density maximization method is employed to hide the attacked entities in dense regions in two KGs, such that the derived perturbations are unnoticeable. Second, an attack signal amplification method is developed to reduce the gradient vanishing issues in the process of adversarial attacks for further improving the attack effectiveness.",,,
244117167,Annotators with Attitudes: How Annotator Beliefs And Identities Bias Toxic Language Detection,"Warning: this paper discusses and contains content that is offensive or upsetting.The perceived toxicity of language can vary based on someone's identity and beliefs, but this variation is often ignored when collecting toxic language datasets, resulting in dataset and model biases. We seek to understand the who, why, and what behind biases in toxicity annotations. In two online studies with demographically and politically diverse participants, we investigate the effect of annotator identities (who) and beliefs (why), drawing from social psychology research about hate speech, free speech, racist beliefs, political leaning, and more. We disentangle what is annotated as toxic by considering posts with three characteristics: anti-Black language, African American English (AAE) dialect, and vulgarity. Our results show strong associations between annotator identity and beliefs and their ratings of toxicity. Notably, more conservative annotators and those who scored highly on our scale for racist beliefs were less likely to rate anti-Black language as toxic, but more likely to rate AAE as toxic. We additionally present a case study illustrating how a popular toxicity detection system's ratings inherently reflect only specific beliefs and perspectives. Our findings call for contextualizing toxicity labels in social variables, which raises immense implications for toxic language annotation and detection.Text Categories",,,
244117789,DISTRIBUTION COMPRESSION IN NEAR-LINEAR TIME,"In distribution compression, one aims to accurately summarize a probability distribution P using a small number of representative points. Near-optimal thinning procedures achieve this goal by sampling n points from a Markov chain and identifying √ n points with O(1/ √ n) discrepancy to P. Unfortunately, these algorithms suffer from quadratic or super-quadratic runtime in the sample size n. To address this deficiency, we introduce Compress++, a simple meta-procedure for speeding up any thinning algorithm while suffering at most a factor of 4 in error. When combined with the quadratic-time kernel halving and kernel thinning algorithms of Dwivedi and Mackey(2021), Compress++ delivers √ n points with O( log n/n) integration error and better-than-Monte-Carlo maximum mean discrepancy in O(n log 3 n) time and O( √ n log 2 n) space. Moreover, Compress++ enjoys the same near-linear runtime given any quadratic-time input and reduces the runtime of super-quadratic algorithms by a square-root factor. In our benchmarks with high-dimensional Monte Carlo samples and Markov chains targeting challenging differential equation posteriors, Compress++ matches or nearly matches the accuracy of its input algorithm in orders of magnitude less time.arXiv:2111.07941v6 [stat.ML] 18 Oct 2022Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022Definition 2 (Sub-Gaussian thinning algorithm) For a function f , we call a thinning algorithm ALG f -sub-Gaussian with parameter ν and write ALG ∈ G f (ν) ifDef. 2 is equivalent to a sub-Gaussian tail bound for the integration error, and, by Boucheron et al.

244270388,Transparent Human Evaluation for Image Captioning,"We establish THUMB, a rubric-based human evaluation protocol for image captioning models. Our scoring rubrics and their definitions are carefully developed based on machine-and human-generated captions on the MSCOCO dataset. Each caption is evaluated along two main dimensions in a tradeoff (precision and recall) as well as other aspects that measure the text quality (fluency, conciseness, and inclusive language). Our evaluations demonstrate several critical problems of the current evaluation practice. Human-generated captions show substantially higher quality than machine-generated ones, especially in coverage of salient information (i.e., recall), while most automatic metrics say the opposite. Our rubric-based results reveal that CLIPScore, a recent metric that uses image features, better correlates with human judgments than conventional text-only metrics because it is more sensitive to recall. We hope that this work will promote a more transparent evaluation protocol for image captioning and its automatic metrics. 1 . 2015.

244345901,SUMMAC: Re-Visiting NLI-based Models for Inconsistency Detection in Summarization,"In the summarization domain, a key requirement for summaries is to be factually consistent with the input document. Previous work has found that natural language inference (NLI) models do not perform competitively when applied to inconsistency detection. In this work, we revisit the use of NLI for inconsistency detection, finding that past work suffered from a mismatch in input granularity between NLI datasets (sentence-level), and inconsistency detection (document level). We provide a highly effective and light-weight method called SUMMAC CONV that enables NLI models to be successfully used for this task by segmenting documents into sentence units and aggregating scores between pairs of sentences. We furthermore introduce a new benchmark called SUMMAC (Summary Consistency) which consists of six large inconsistency detection datasets. On this dataset, SUMMAC Conv obtains state-of-the-art results with a balanced accuracy of 74.4%, a 5% improvement compared with prior work. *",,,

While many neural IR methods encode queries and documents into single-vector representations, late interaction models produce multi-vector representations at the granularity of each token and decompose relevance modeling into scalable token-level computations. This decomposition has been shown to make late interaction more effective, but it inflates the space footprint of these models by an order of magnitude. In this work, we introduce ColBERTv2, a retriever that couples an aggressive residual compression mechanism with a denoised supervision strategy to simultaneously improve the quality and space footprint of late interaction. We evaluate ColBERTv2 across a wide range of benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art quality within and outside the training domain while reducing the space footprint of late interaction models by 6-10×.",,,
244908535,Training Structured Neural Networks Through Mani- fold Identification and Variance Reduction,"This paper proposes an algorithm, RMDA, for training neural networks (NNs) with a regularization term for promoting desired structures. RMDA does not incur computation additional to proximal SGD with momentum, and achieves variance reduction without requiring the objective function to be of the finite-sum form. Through the tool of manifold identification from nonlinear optimization, we prove that after a finite number of iterations, all iterates of RMDA possess a desired structure identical to that induced by the regularizer at the stationary point of asymptotic convergence, even in the presence of engineering tricks like data augmentation that complicate the training process. Experiments on training NNs with structured sparsity confirm that variance reduction is necessary for such an identification, and show that RMDA thus significantly outperforms existing methods for this task. For unstructured sparsity, RMDA also outperforms a state-of-the-art pruning method, validating the benefits of training structured NNs through regularization.

244920632,A CONDITIONAL POINT DIFFUSION-REFINEMENT PARADIGM FOR 3D POINT CLOUD COMPLETION,"3D point cloud is an important 3D representation for capturing real world 3D objects. However, real-scanned 3D point clouds are often incomplete, and it is important to recover complete point clouds for downstream applications. Most existing point cloud completion methods use Chamfer Distance (CD) loss for training. The CD loss estimates correspondences between two point clouds by searching nearest neighbors, which does not capture the overall point density distribution on the generated shape, and therefore likely leads to non-uniform point cloud generation. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Point Diffusion-Refinement (PDR) paradigm for point cloud completion. PDR consists of a Conditional Generation Network (CGNet) and a ReFinement Network (RFNet). The CGNet uses a conditional generative model called the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to generate a coarse completion conditioned on the partial observation. DDPM establishes a one-to-one pointwise mapping between the generated point cloud and the uniform ground truth, and then optimizes the mean squared error loss to realize uniform generation. The RFNet refines the coarse output of the CGNet and further improves quality of the completed point cloud. Furthermore, we develop a novel dual-path architecture for both networks. The architecture can (1) effectively and efficiently extract multi-level features from partially observed point clouds to guide completion, and (2) accurately manipulate spatial locations of 3D points to obtain smooth surfaces and sharp details. Extensive experimental results on various benchmark datasets show that our PDR paradigm outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for point cloud completion. Remarkably, with the help of the RFNet, we can accelerate the iterative generation process of the DDPM by up to 50 times without much performance drop. * Equal Contribution.Code is released at https://github.com/ZhaoyangLyu/Point_ Diffusion_Refinement. . 3d shape generation and completion through point-voxel diffusion. arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.03670, 2021.",,,
244954670,VIRT: Improving Representation-based Text Matching via Virtual Interaction,"Text matching is a fundamental research problem in natural language understanding. Interaction-based approaches treat the text pair as a single sequence and encode it through cross encoders, while representation-based models encode the text pair independently with siamese or dual encoders. Interactionbased models require dense computations and thus are impractical in real-world applications. Representation-based models have become the mainstream paradigm for efficient text matching. However, these models suffer from severe performance degradation due to the lack of interactions between the pair of texts. To remedy this, we propose a Virtual InteRacTion mechanism (VIRT) for improving representation-based text matching while maintaining its efficiency. In particular, we introduce an interactive knowledge distillation module that is only applied during training. It enables deep interaction between texts by effectively transferring knowledge from the interaction-based model. A light interaction strategy is designed to fully leverage the learned interactive knowledge. Experimental results on six text matching benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method over several state-of-the-art representationbased models. We further show that VIRT can be integrated into existing methods as plugins to lift their performances.",,,
245117682,AN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN PERSPECTIVE ON MODEL-BASED REINFORCEMENT LEARNING,"In many practical applications of RL, it is expensive to observe state transitions from the environment. For example, in the problem of plasma control for nuclear fusion, computing the next state for a given state-action pair requires querying an expensive transition function which can lead to many hours of computer simulation or dollars of scientific research. Such expensive data collection prohibits application of standard RL algorithms which usually require a large number of observations to learn. In this work, we address the problem of efficiently learning a policy while making a minimal number of state-action queries to the transition function. In particular, we leverage ideas from Bayesian optimal experimental design to guide the selection of state-action queries for efficient learning. We propose an acquisition function that quantifies how much information a state-action pair would provide about the optimal solution to a Markov decision process. At each iteration, our algorithm maximizes this acquisition function, to choose the most informative state-action pair to be queried, thus yielding a data-efficient RL approach. We experiment with a variety of simulated continuous control problems and show that our approach learns an optimal policy with up to 5 -1, 000× less data than modelbased RL baselines and 10 3 -10 5 × less data than model-free RL baselines. We also provide several ablated comparisons which point to substantial improvements arising from the principled method of obtaining data.",,,
245123899,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 CONTEXTUALIZED SCENE IMAGINATION FOR GENERATIVE COMMONSENSE REASONING,"Humans use natural language to compose common concepts from their environment into plausible, day-to-day scene descriptions. However, such generative commonsense reasoning (GCSR) skills are lacking in state-of-the-art text generation methods. Descriptive sentences about arbitrary concepts generated by neural text generation models (e.g., pre-trained text-to-text Transformers) are often grammatically fluent but may not correspond to human common sense, largely due to their lack of mechanisms to capture concept relations, to identify implicit concepts, and to perform generalizable reasoning about unseen concept compositions. In this paper, we propose an Imagine-and-Verbalize (I&V) method, which learns to imagine a relational scene knowledge graph (SKG) with relations between the input concepts, and leverage the SKG as a constraint when generating a plausible scene description. We collect and harmonize a set of knowledge resources from different domains and modalities, providing a rich auxiliary supervision signal for I&V. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of I&V in improving language models on both concept-to-sentence and concept-to-story generation tasks, while enabling the model to learn well from fewer task examples and generate SKGs that make common sense to human annotators 1 . * Equal contributions 1 Code and data are available at https",,,
245123905,STEP-UNROLLED DENOISING AUTOENCODERS FOR TEXT GENERATION,"In this paper we propose a new generative model of text, Step-unrolled Denoising Autoencoder (SUNDAE), that does not rely on autoregressive models. Similarly to denoising diffusion techniques, SUNDAE is repeatedly applied on a sequence of tokens, starting from random inputs and improving them each time until convergence. We present a simple new improvement operator that converges in fewer iterations than diffusion methods, while qualitatively producing better samples on natural language datasets. SUNDAE achieves state-of-the-art results (among non-autoregressive methods) on the WMT'14 English-to-German translation task and good qualitative results on unconditional language modeling on the Colossal Cleaned Common Crawl dataset and a dataset of Python code from GitHub. The non-autoregressive nature of SUNDAE opens up possibilities beyond left-to-right prompted generation, by filling in arbitrary blank patterns in a template.Autoregressive (AR) models have shown excellent results in generating text (e.g., GPT-3, Brown  et al., 2020). However, while their training scales very well, sampling is prohibitively slow for many practical applications. Moreover, there are limitations to the kinds of conditioning AR models can seamlessly handle: the left-to-right restriction makes it hard to ""fill in the gaps"" in a partially written text draft. Even more importantly, this prohibits iterative refinement of complete text drafts to make them more self-consistent, which is a common task for human writers. Finally, AR models require network architectures to be causal, severely limiting the kinds of neural network architectures that can be used for text-modeling. All of these motivated the machine learning community to make extensive efforts to propose alternatives to AR models.Machine translation (MT) was perhaps one of the first tasks where non-AR approaches were shown to seriously rival the AR-based state of the art: methods like CMLM (Ghazvininejad et al., 2019)  and DisCo (Kasai et al., 2020)  show promising results and their decoding speed is excellent compared to AR. However, while their performance is competitive, they are still behind the AR benchmark and actually require distillation of a larger AR model -without which, performance drops considerably.Non-AR methods have proven hard to apply to the general unconditional language modeling (LM) task. When there is no conditioning, the multi-modality problem becomes paramount, as shown by Gu et al. (2017), which likely makes it problematic to use methods like CMLM and DisCo because their decoding mechanism is deterministic and does not model uncertainty. Yet, recently the community has seen promising results from non-AR models like Multinomial Diffusion (Hoogeboom et al., 2021)  and D3PM (Austin et al., 2021). These methods optimize a lower bound (ELBO) on likelihoods and have shown negative log-likelihood (NLL) results approaching AR models on several benchmarks like text8 (Mahoney, 2011) and LM1B (Chelba et al., 2013). However, a major gap in NLL persists, and samples from those models lack coherence.In this paper we propose a novel non-autoregressive method which shows state-of-the-art results in machine translation on WMT'14 EN→DE raw data (without distillation from AR) amongst non-AR methods and good qualitative results on unconditional language modeling on the Colossal Clean Common Crawl (C4) dataset(Raffel et al., 2019)and a dataset of Python code from GitHub. Our model operates as a time-homogeneous Markov Chain similar to that of Lee et al.

245123965,Sparse Interventions in Language Models with Differentiable Masking,"There has been a lot of interest in understanding what information is captured by hidden representations of language models (LMs). Typically, interpretation methods i) do not guarantee that the model actually uses the encoded information, and ii) do not discover small subsets of neurons responsible for a considered phenomenon. Inspired by causal mediation analysis, we propose a method that discovers within a neural LM a small subset of neurons responsible for a particular linguistic phenomenon, i.e., subsets causing a change in the corresponding token emission probabilities. We use a differentiable relaxation to approximately search through the combinatorial space. An L 0 regularization term ensures that the search converges to discrete and sparse solutions. We apply our method to analyze subject-verb number agreement and gender bias detection in LSTMs. We observe that it is fast and finds better solutions than the alternative (REINFORCE). Our experiments confirm that each of these phenomenons is mediated through a small subset of neurons that do not play any other discernible role.",,,
245130931,MULTIVERS: Improving scientific claim verification with weak supervision and full-document context,"The scientific claim verification task requires an NLP system to label scientific documents which SUPPORT or REFUTE an input claim, and to select evidentiary sentences (or rationales) justifying each predicted label. In this work, we present MULTIVERS, which predicts a fact-checking label and identifies rationales in a multitask fashion based on a shared encoding of the claim and full document context. This approach accomplishes two key modeling goals. First, it ensures that all relevant contextual information is incorporated into each labeling decision. Second, it enables the model to learn from instances annotated with a document-level fact-checking label, but lacking sentence-level rationales. This allows MULTIVERS to perform weakly-supervised domain adaptation by training on scientific documents labeled using high-precision heuristics. Our approach outperforms two competitive baselines on three scientific claim verification datasets, with particularly strong performance in zero / few-shot domain adaptation experiments.

245144839,GenIE: Generative Information Extraction,"Structured and grounded representation of text is typically formalized by closed information extraction, the problem of extracting an exhaustive set of (subject, relation, object) triplets that are consistent with a predefined set of entities and relations from a knowledge base schema. Most existing works are pipelines prone to error accumulation, and all approaches are only applicable to unrealistically small numbers of entities and relations. We introduce GenIE (generative information extraction), the first end-to-end autoregressive formulation of closed information extraction. GenIE naturally exploits the language knowledge from the pre-trained transformer by autoregressively generating relations and entities in textual form. Thanks to a new bi-level constrained generation strategy, only triplets consistent with the predefined knowledge base schema are produced. Our experiments show that GenIE is state-of-the-art on closed information extraction, generalizes from fewer training data points than baselines, and scales to a previously unmanageable number of entities and relations. With this work, closed information extraction becomes practical in realistic scenarios, providing new opportunities for downstream tasks. Finally, this work paves the way towards a unified end-to-end approach to the core tasks of information extraction.",,,
245335427,OBJECT PURSUIT: BUILDING A SPACE OF OBJECTS VIA DISCRIMINATIVE WEIGHT GENERATION,"We propose a framework to continuously learn object-centric representations for visual learning and understanding. Existing object-centric representations either rely on supervisions that individualize objects in the scene, or perform unsupervised disentanglement that can hardly deal with complex scenes in the real world. To mitigate the annotation burden and relax the constraints on the statistical complexity of the data, our method leverages interactions to effectively sample diverse variations of an object and the corresponding training signals while learning the object-centric representations. Throughout learning, objects are streamed one by one in random order with unknown identities, and are associated with latent codes that can synthesize discriminative weights for each object through a convolutional hypernetwork. Moreover, re-identification of learned objects and forgetting prevention are employed to make the learning process efficient and robust. We perform an extensive study of the key features of the proposed framework and analyze the characteristics of the learned representations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework in learning representations that can improve label efficiency in downstream tasks. Our code and trained models are made publicly available at: https://github.com/pptrick/ Object-Pursuit. * Equal Contribution.arXiv:2112.07954v3 [cs.CV] 3 Apr 2022Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022We employ network weights as the object-centric representations. Specifically, the proposed method learns an object-centric representation from the data collected by manipulating a single object, through learning a latent code that can be translated into a neural network. The neural network is produced by a discriminative weight generation hypernetwork and is able to distinguish the represented object from anything else. In order to learn representations for objects that stream in one by one, the proposed framework is augmented with an object re-identification procedure to avoid learning seen objects. Moreover, we hypothesize that object representations are embedded in a low-dimensional manifold, so the proposed framework first checks whether a new object can be represented by learned objects; if not, the new object will be learned as a base object serving the purpose of representing future objects, thus the name object pursuit. Furthermore, the proposed framework deals with the catastrophic forgetting of learned object representations by enforcing the hypernetwork to maintain the mapping between the learned representations and their corresponding network weights.In summary, our work makes the following contributions: 1) we propose a novel framework named object pursuit that can continuously learn object-centric representations using training data collected from interactions with individual objects, 2) we perform an extensive study to understand the pursuit dynamics and characterize its typical behaviors regarding the key design features, and 3) we analyze the learned object space, in terms of its succinctness and effectiveness in representing objects, and empirically demonstrate its potential for label efficient visual learning. learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10368, 2017.Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila.

245855878,A Fine-Grained Analysis of BERTScore,"BERTScore(Zhang et al., 2020), a recently proposed automatic metric for machine translation quality, uses BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), a large pre-trained language model to evaluate candidate translations with respect to a gold translation. Taking advantage of BERT's semantic and syntactic abilities, BERTScore seeks to avoid the flaws of earlier approaches like BLEU, instead scoring candidate translations based on their semantic similarity to the gold sentence. However, BERT is not infallible; while its performance on NLP tasks set a new state of the art in general, studies of specific syntactic and semantic phenomena have shown where BERT's performance deviates from that of humans more generally.This naturally raises the questions we address in this paper: what are the strengths and weaknesses of BERTScore? Do they relate to known weaknesses on the part of BERT? We find that while BERTScore can detect when a candidate differs from a reference in important content words, it is less sensitive to smaller errors, especially if the candidate is lexically or stylistically similar to the reference.",,,

245906072,Implicit Bias of MSE Gradient Optimization in Underparameterized Neural Networks,"We study the dynamics of a neural network in function space when optimizing the mean squared error via gradient flow. We show that in the underparameterized regime the network learns eigenfunctions of an integral operator TK∞ determined by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) at rates corresponding to their eigenvalues. For example, for uniformly distributed data on the sphere S d−1 and rotation invariant weight distributions, the eigenfunctions of TK∞ are the spherical harmonics. Our results can be understood as describing a spectral bias in the underparameterized regime. The proofs use the concept of ""Damped Deviations"", where deviations of the NTK matter less for eigendirections with large eigenvalues due to the occurence of a damping factor. Aside from the underparameterized regime, the damped deviations point-of-view can be used to track the dynamics of the empirical risk in the overparameterized setting, allowing us to extend certain results in the literature. We conclude that damped deviations offers a simple and unifying perspective of the dynamics when optimizing the squared error.",,,
246015393,Unobserved Local Structures Make Compositional Generalization Hard,"While recent work has shown that sequence-tosequence models struggle to generalize to new compositions (termed compositional generalization), little is known on what makes compositional generalization hard on a particular test instance. In this work, we investigate the factors that make generalization to certain test instances challenging. We first substantiate that some examples are more difficult than others by showing that different models consistently fail or succeed on the same test instances. Then, we propose a criterion for the difficulty of an example: a test instance is hard if it contains a local structure that was not observed at training time. We formulate a simple decision rule based on this criterion and empirically show it predicts instance-level generalization well across 5 different semantic parsing datasets, substantially better than alternative decision rules. Last, we show local structures can be leveraged for creating difficult adversarial compositional splits and also to improve compositional generalization under limited training budgets by strategically selecting examples for the training set.",,,

Our approach utilizes Bayesian world models, and harnesses the resulting uncertainty to maximize optimistic upper bounds on the task objective, as well as pessimistic upper bounds on the safety constraints. We demonstrate LAMBDA's state of the art performance on the Safety-Gym benchmark suite in terms of sample efficiency and constraint violation.",,,
246294808,ON THE CONVERGENCE OF MSGD AND ADAGRAD FOR STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION,"As one of the most fundamental stochastic optimization algorithms, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been intensively developed and extensively applied in machine learning in the past decade. There have been some modified SGD-type algorithms, which outperform the SGD in many competitions and applications in terms of convergence rate and accuracy, such as momentum-based SGD (mSGD) and adaptive gradient algorithm (AdaGrad). Despite these empirical successes, the theoretical properties of these algorithms have not been well established due to technical difficulties. With this motivation, we focus on convergence analysis of mSGD and AdaGrad for any smooth (possibly non-convex) loss functions in stochastic optimization. First, we prove that the iterates of mSGD are asymptotically convergent to a connected set of stationary points with probability one, which is more general than existing works on subsequence convergence or convergence of time averages. Moreover, we prove that the loss function of mSGD decays at a certain rate faster than that of SGD. In addition, we prove the iterates of AdaGrad are asymptotically convergent to a connected set of stationary points with probability one. Also, this result extends the results from the literature on subsequence convergence and the convergence of time averages. Despite the generality of the above convergence results, we have relaxed some assumptions of gradient noises, convexity of loss functions, as well as boundedness of iterates.",,,
246430476,THE KFIOU LOSS FOR ROTATED OBJECT DETECTION,"Differing from the well-developed horizontal object detection area whereby the computing-friendly IoU based loss is readily adopted and well fits with the detection metrics. In contrast, rotation detectors often involve a more complicated loss based on SkewIoU which is unfriendly to gradient-based training. In this paper, we propose an effective approximate SkewIoU loss based on Gaussian modeling and Gaussian product, which mainly consists of two items. The first term is a scale-insensitive center point loss, which is used to quickly narrow the distance between the center points of the two bounding boxes. In the distance-independent second term, the product of the Gaussian distributions is adopted to inherently mimic the mechanism of SkewIoU by its definition, and show its alignment with the SkewIoU loss at trend-level within a certain distance (i.e. within 9 pixels). This is in contrast to recent Gaussian modeling based rotation detectors e.g. GWD loss and KLD loss that involve a human-specified distribution distance metric which require additional hyperparameter tuning that vary across datasets and detectors. The resulting new loss called KFIoU loss is easier to implement and works better compared with exact SkewIoU loss, thanks to its full differentiability and ability to handle the non-overlapping cases. We further extend our technique to the 3-D case which also suffers from the same issues as 2-D. Extensive results on various public datasets (2-D/3-D, aerial/text/face images) with different base detectors show the effectiveness of our approach.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 20231 See an open-source version with thousands of lines of code for implementing the loss at https:// github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv/pull/1854, while our new loss only costs tens of lines of code. 2  The product of the Gaussian distributions is an important procedure in Kalman filtering. Inspired by Kalman filtering, we mark the proposed loss as KFIoU loss.",,,
246430569,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 PROTORES: PROTO-RESIDUAL NETWORK FOR POSE AUTHORING VIA LEARNED INVERSE KINEMATICS,"Our work focuses on the development of a learnable neural representation of human pose for advanced AI assisted animation tooling. Specifically, we tackle the problem of constructing a full static human pose based on sparse and variable user inputs (e.g. locations and/or orientations of a subset of body joints). To solve this problem, we propose a novel neural architecture that combines residual connections with prototype encoding of a partially specified pose to create a new complete pose from the learned latent space. We show that our architecture outperforms a baseline based on Transformer, both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, we develop a user interface to integrate our neural model in Unity, a real-time 3D development platform. Furthermore, we introduce two new datasets representing the static human pose modeling problem, based on high-quality human motion capture data.

246430796,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 DECEPTICONS: CORRUPTED TRANSFORMERS BREACH PRIVACY IN FEDERATED LEARNING FOR LANGUAGE MODELS,"Privacy is a central tenet of Federated learning (FL), in which a central server trains models without centralizing user data. However, gradient updates used in FL can leak user information. While the most industrial uses of FL are for text applications (e.g. keystroke prediction), the majority of attacks on user privacy in FL have focused on simple image classifiers and threat models that assume honest execution of the FL protocol from the server. We propose a novel attack that reveals private user text by deploying malicious parameter vectors, and which succeeds even with mini-batches, multiple users, and long sequences. Unlike previous attacks on FL, the attack exploits characteristics of both the Transformer architecture and the token embedding, separately extracting tokens and positional embeddings to retrieve high-fidelity text. We argue that the threat model of malicious server states is highly relevant from a user-centric perspective, and show that in this scenario, text applications using transformer models are much more vulnerable than previously thought. * Authors contributed equally.

246431014,LEARNING SUPER-FEATURES FOR IMAGE RETRIEVAL,"Methods that combine local and global features have recently shown excellent performance on multiple challenging deep image retrieval benchmarks, but their use of local features raises at least two issues. First, these local features simply boil down to the localized map activations of a neural network, and hence can be extremely redundant. Second, they are typically trained with a global loss that only acts on top of an aggregation of local features; by contrast, testing is based on local feature matching, which creates a discrepancy between training and testing. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for deep image retrieval, based solely on mid-level features that we call Super-features. These Super-features are constructed by an iterative attention module and constitute an ordered set in which each element focuses on a localized and discriminant image pattern. For training, they require only image labels. A contrastive loss operates directly at the level of Super-features and focuses on those that match across images. A second complementary loss encourages diversity. Experiments on common landmark retrieval benchmarks validate that Super-features substantially outperform state-of-the-art methods when using the same number of features, and only require a significantly smaller memory footprint to match their performance. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/naver/FIRe.arXiv:2201.13182v1 [cs.CV] 31 Jan 2022Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 1 The term 'query' has a precise meaning for retrieval; yet, for this subsection only, we overload the term to refer to one of the inputs of the dot-product attention, consistently with the terminology from seminal works on attention byVaswani et al. (2017). 2  The attention maps presented in Eq.(4) are technically taken at iteration t, but we omit iteration superscripts for clarity. For the rest of the paper and visualizations, we use attention maps to refer to the attention maps of Eq.(4) after the final (T -th) iteration of the iterative module. 3  The MLP function consists of a layer-norm, a fully-connected layer with half the dimensions of the features, a ReLU activation and a fully-connected layer that projects features back to their initial dimension.",,,
246634167,DISTRIBUTIONALLY ROBUST FAIR PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS VIA GEODESIC DESCENTS,"Principal component analysis is a simple yet useful dimensionality reduction technique in modern machine learning pipelines. In consequential domains such as college admission, healthcare and credit approval, it is imperative to take into account emerging criteria such as the fairness and the robustness of the learned projection. In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust optimization problem for principal component analysis which internalizes a fairness criterion in the objective function. The learned projection thus balances the trade-off between the total reconstruction error and the reconstruction error gap between subgroups, taken in the min-max sense over all distributions in a moment-based ambiguity set. The resulting optimization problem over the Stiefel manifold can be efficiently solved by a Riemannian subgradient descent algorithm with a sub-linear convergence rate. Our experimental results on real-world datasets show the merits of our proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.",,,
246634506,HANDLING DISTRIBUTION SHIFTS ON GRAPHS: AN INVARIANCE PERSPECTIVE,"There is increasing evidence suggesting neural networks' sensitivity to distribution shifts, so that research on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization comes into the spotlight. Nonetheless, current endeavors mostly focus on Euclidean data, and its formulation for graph-structured data is not clear and remains under-explored, given the two-fold fundamental challenges: 1) the inter-connection among nodes in one graph, which induces non-IID generation of data points even under the same environment, and 2) the structural information in the input graph, which is also informative for prediction. In this paper, we formulate the OOD problem for node-level prediction on graphs and develop a new domain-invariant learning approach, named Explore-to-Extrapolate Risk Minimization, that facilitates GNNs to leverage invariant graph features for prediction. The key difference to existing invariant models is that we design multiple context explorers (specified as graph editers in our case) that are adversarially trained to maximize the variance of risks from multiple virtual environments. Such a design enables the model to extrapolate from a single observed environment which is the common case for node-level prediction. We prove the validity of our method by theoretically showing its guarantee of a valid OOD solution and further demonstrate its power on various real-world datasets for handling distribution shifts from artificial spurious features, cross-domain transfers and dynamic graph evolution.Recent studies of the OOD generalization problem likeRojas-Carulla et al.

246822414,UNSUPERVISED DISENTANGLEMENT WITH TENSOR PRODUCT REPRESENTATIONS ON THE TORUS,"The current methods for learning representations with auto-encoders almost exclusively employ vectors as the latent representations. In this work, we propose to employ a tensor product structure for this purpose. This way, the obtained representations are naturally disentangled. In contrast to the conventional variations methods, which are targeted toward normally distributed features, the latent space in our representation is distributed uniformly over a set of unit circles. We argue that the torus structure of the latent space captures the generative factors effectively. We employ recent tools for measuring unsupervised disentanglement, and in an extensive set of experiments demonstrate the advantage of our method in terms of disentanglement, completeness, and informativeness.

246823263,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING IN PRESENCE OF DIS- CRETE MARKOVIAN CONTEXT EVOLUTION,"We consider a context-dependent Reinforcement Learning (RL) setting, which is characterized by: a) an unknown finite number of not directly observable contexts; b) abrupt (discontinuous) context changes occurring during an episode; and c) Markovian context evolution. We argue that this challenging case is often met in applications and we tackle it using a Bayesian approach and variational inference. We adapt a sticky Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) prior for model learning, which is arguably best-suited for Markov process modeling. We then derive a context distillation procedure, which identifies and removes spurious contexts in an unsupervised fashion. We argue that the combination of these two components allows to infer the number of contexts from data thus dealing with the context cardinality assumption. We then find the representation of the optimal policy enabling efficient policy learning using off-the-shelf RL algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate empirically (using gym environments cart-pole swing-up, drone, intersection) that our approach succeeds where state-of-the-art methods of other frameworks fail and elaborate on the reasons for such failures.",,,
247058853,LEARNING FAST AND SLOW FOR ONLINE TIME SERIES FORECASTING,"Despite the recent success of deep learning for time series forecasting, these methods are not scalable for many real-world applications where data arrives sequentially. Training deep neural forecasters on the fly is notoriously challenging because of their limited ability to adapt to non-stationary environments and remember old knowledge. We argue that the fast adaptation capability of deep neural networks is critical and successful solutions require handling changes to both new and recurring patterns effectively. In this work, inspired by the Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory, we propose Fast and Slow learning Network (FS-Net) as a novel framework to address the challenges of online forecasting. Particularly, FSNet improves the slowly-learned backbone by dynamically balancing fast adaptation to recent changes and retrieving similar old knowledge. FSNet achieves this mechanism via an interaction between two novel complementary components: (i) a per-layer adapter to support fast learning from individual layers, and (ii) an associative memory to support remembering, updating, and recalling repeating events. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets validate FSNet's efficacy and robustness to both new and recurring patterns. Our code is available at https://github.com/salesforce/fsnet.",,,

In this work, we propose a novel lightweight framework for controllable GPT2 (Radford et al., 2019) generation, which utilizes a set of small attribute-specific vectors, called prefixes (Li and Liang, 2021), to steer natural language generation. Different from Li and Liang (2021), where each prefix is trained independently, we take the relationship among prefixes into consideration and train multiple prefixes simultaneously, as illustrated inFigure 1. We propose a novel supervised method and also an unsupervised method to train the prefixes for single-aspect control while the combination of these two methods can achieve multi-aspect control. Experimental results on both singleaspect and multi-aspect control show that our methods can guide generation towards the desired attributes while keeping high linguistic quality.",,,
247187518,MERIt: Meta-Path Guided Contrastive Learning for Logical Reasoning,"Logical reasoning is of vital importance to natural language understanding. Previous studies either employ graph-based models to incorporate prior knowledge about logical relations, or introduce symbolic logic into neural models through data augmentation. These methods, however, heavily depend on annotated training data, and thus suffer from overfitting and poor generalization problems due to the dataset sparsity. To address these two problems, in this paper, we propose MERIt, a MEta-path guided contrastive learning method for logical ReasonIng of text, to perform selfsupervised pre-training on abundant unlabeled text data. Two novel strategies serve as indispensable components of our method. In particular, a strategy based on meta-path is devised to discover the logical structure in natural texts, followed by a counterfactual data augmentation strategy to eliminate the information shortcut induced by pre-training. The experimental results on two challenging logical reasoning benchmarks, i.e., ReClor and LogiQA, demonstrate that our method outperforms the SOTA baselines with significant improvements. 1 * Corresponding author: Yangyang Guo and Liqiang Nie. 1 Our code and pre-trained models are available at https: //github.com/SparkJiao/MERIt. 2  We refer the term logical reasoning to the task itself in the remaining of this paper.",,,
247222761,CONTINUOUS-TIME META-LEARNING WITH FORWARD MODE DIFFERENTIATION,"Drawing inspiration from gradient-based meta-learning methods with infinitely small gradient steps, we introduce Continuous-Time Meta-Learning (COMLN), a meta-learning algorithm where adaptation follows the dynamics of a gradient vector field. Specifically, representations of the inputs are meta-learned such that a taskspecific linear classifier is obtained as a solution of an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Treating the learning process as an ODE offers the notable advantage that the length of the trajectory is now continuous, as opposed to a fixed and discrete number of gradient steps. As a consequence, we can optimize the amount of adaptation necessary to solve a new task using stochastic gradient descent, in addition to learning the initial conditions as is standard practice in gradient-based meta-learning. Importantly, in order to compute the exact meta-gradients required for the outer-loop updates, we devise an efficient algorithm based on forward mode differentiation, whose memory requirements do not scale with the length of the learning trajectory, thus allowing longer adaptation in constant memory. We provide analytical guarantees for the stability of COMLN, we show empirically its efficiency in terms of runtime and memory usage, and we illustrate its effectiveness on a range of few-shot image classification problems. .

247292326,ACCELERATION OF FEDERATED LEARNING WITH ALLEVIATED FORGETTING IN LOCAL TRAINING,"Federated learning (FL) enables distributed optimization of machine learning models while protecting privacy by independently training local models on each client and then aggregating parameters on a central server, thereby producing an effective global model. Although a variety of FL algorithms have been proposed, their training efficiency remains low when the data are not independently and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) across different clients. We observe that the slow convergence rates of the existing methods are (at least partially) caused by the catastrophic forgetting issue during the local training stage on each individual client, which leads to a large increase in the loss function concerning the previous training data at the other clients. Here, we propose FedReg, an algorithm to accelerate FL with alleviated knowledge forgetting in the local training stage by regularizing locally trained parameters with the loss on generated pseudo data, which encode the knowledge of previous training data learned by the global model. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FedReg not only significantly improves the convergence rate of FL, especially when the neural network architecture is deep and the clients' data are extremely non-i.i.d., but is also able to protect privacy better in classification problems and more robust against gradient inversion attacks.

247315559,UniXcoder: Unified Cross-Modal Pre-training for Code Representation,"Pre-trained models for programming languages have recently demonstrated great success on code intelligence. To support both code-related understanding and generation tasks, recent works attempt to pre-train unified encoder-decoder models. However, such encoder-decoder framework is sub-optimal for auto-regressive tasks, especially code completion that requires a decoder-only manner for efficient inference. In this paper, we present UniXcoder, a unified cross-modal pre-trained model for programming language. The model utilizes mask attention matrices with prefix adapters to control the behavior of the model and leverages cross-modal contents like AST and code comment to enhance code representation. To encode AST that is represented as a tree in parallel, we propose a one-to-one mapping method to transform AST in a sequence structure that retains all structural information from the tree. Furthermore, we propose to utilize multi-modal contents to learn representation of code fragment with contrastive learning, and then align representations among programming languages using a cross-modal generation task. We evaluate UniXcoder on five code-related tasks over nine datasets. To further evaluate the performance of code fragment representation, we also construct a dataset for a new task, called zero-shot code-to-code search. Results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on most tasks and analysis reveals that comment and AST can both enhance UniXcoder.",,,

Existing benchmarks have some shortcomings that limit the development of Complex KBQA: 1) they only provide QA pairs without explicit reasoning processes; 2) questions are poor in diversity or scale. To this end, we introduce KQA Pro, a dataset for Complex KBQA including 120K diverse natural language questions. We introduce a compositional and interpretable programming language KoPL to represent the reasoning process of complex questions. For each question, we provide the corresponding KoPL program and SPARQL query, so that KQA Pro serves for both KBQA and semantic parsing tasks. Experimental results show that SOTA KBQA methods cannot achieve promising results on KQA Pro as on current datasets, which suggests that KQA Pro is challenging and Complex KBQA requires further research efforts. We also treat KQA Pro as a diagnostic dataset for testing multiple reasoning skills, conduct a thorough evaluation of existing models and discuss further directions for Complex KBQA. Our codes and datasets can be obtained from https://github.com/shijx12/ KQAPro_Baselines.",,,
247411350,Long Time No See! Open-Domain Conversation with Long-Term Persona Memory,"Most of the open-domain dialogue models tend to perform poorly in the setting of long-term human-bot conversations. The possible reason is that they lack the capability of understanding and memorizing long-term dialogue history information. To address this issue, we present a novel task of Long-term Memory Conversation (LeMon) and then build a new dialogue dataset DuLeMon and a dialogue generation framework PLATO-LTM with a Long-Term Memory (LTM) mechanism. This LTM mechanism enables our system to accurately extract and continuously update long-term persona memory without requiring multiple-session dialogue datasets for model training. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to conduct real-time dynamic management of persona information of both parties, including the user and the bot. Results on DuLeMon indicate that PLATO-LTM can significantly outperform baselines in terms of long-term dialogue consistency, leading to better dialogue engagingness 1 .",,,
247446712,INVERSE ONLINE LEARNING: UNDERSTANDING NON- STATIONARY AND REACTIONARY POLICIES,"Human decision making is well known to be imperfect and the ability to analyse such processes individually is crucial when attempting to aid or improve a decisionmaker's ability to perform a task, e.g. to alert them to potential biases or oversights on their part. To do so, it is necessary to develop interpretable representations of how agents make decisions and how this process changes over time as the agent learns online in reaction to the accrued experience. To then understand the decisionmaking processes underlying a set of observed trajectories, we cast the policy inference problem as the inverse to this online learning problem. By interpreting actions within a potential outcomes framework, we introduce a meaningful mapping based on agents choosing an action they believe to have the greatest treatment effect. We introduce a practical algorithm for retrospectively estimating such perceived effects, alongside the process through which agents update them, using a novel architecture built upon an expressive family of deep state-space models. Through application to the analysis of UNOS organ donation acceptance decisions, we demonstrate that our approach can bring valuable insights into the factors that govern decision processes and how they change over time.",,,
247450846,SURROGATE GAP MINIMIZATION IMPROVES SHARPNESS-AWARE TRAINING,"The recently proposed Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization by minimizing a perturbed loss defined as the maximum loss within a neighborhood in the parameter space. However, we show that both sharp and flat minima can have a low perturbed loss, implying that SAM does not always prefer flat minima. Instead, we define a surrogate gap, a measure equivalent to the dominant eigenvalue of Hessian at a local minimum when the radius of neighborhood (to derive the perturbed loss) is small. The surrogate gap is easy to compute and feasible for direct minimization during training. Based on the above observations, we propose Surrogate Gap Guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM), a novel improvement over SAM with negligible computation overhead. Conceptually, GSAM consists of two steps: 1) a gradient descent like SAM to minimize the perturbed loss, and 2) an ascent step in the orthogonal direction (after gradient decomposition) to minimize the surrogate gap and yet not affect the perturbed loss. GSAM seeks a region with both small loss (by step 1) and low sharpness (by step 2), giving rise to a model with high generalization capabilities. Theoretically, we show the convergence of GSAM and provably better generalization than SAM. Empirically, GSAM consistently improves generalization (e.g., +3.2% over SAM and +5.4% over AdamW on ImageNet top-1 accuracy for ViT-B/32). Code is released at https",,,
247451267,TOWARDS BUILDING A GROUP-BASED UNSUPER- VISED REPRESENTATION DISENTANGLEMENT FRAME- WORK,"Disentangled representation learning is one of the major goals of deep learning, and is a key step for achieving explainable and generalizable models. A well-defined theoretical guarantee still lacks for the VAE-based unsupervised methods, which are a set of popular methods to achieve unsupervised disentanglement. The Group Theory based definition of representation disentanglement mathematically connects the data transformations to the representations using the formalism of group. In this paper, built on the group-based definition and inspired by the n-th dihedral group, we first propose a theoretical framework towards achieving unsupervised representation disentanglement. We then propose a model, based on existing VAEbased methods, to tackle the unsupervised learning problem of the framework. In the theoretical framework, we prove three sufficient conditions on model, group structure, and data respectively in an effort to achieve, in an unsupervised way, disentangled representation per group-based definition. With the first two of the conditions satisfied and a necessary condition derived for the third one, we offer additional constraints, from the perspective of the group-based definition, for the existing VAE-based models. Experimentally, we train 1800 models covering the most prominent VAE-based methods on five datasets to verify the effectiveness of our theoretical framework. Compared to the original VAE-based methods, these Groupified VAEs consistently achieve better mean performance with smaller variances.",,,
247451284,Structural Characterization for Dialogue Disentanglement,"Tangled multi-party dialogue contexts lead to challenges for dialogue reading comprehension, where multiple dialogue threads flow simultaneously within a common dialogue record, increasing difficulties in understanding the dialogue history for both human and machine. Previous studies mainly focus on utterance encoding methods with carefully designed features but pay inadequate attention to characteristic features of the structure of dialogues. We specially take structure factors into account and design a novel model for dialogue disentangling. Based on the fact that dialogues are constructed on successive participation and interactions between speakers, we model structural information of dialogues in two aspects: 1)speaker property that indicates whom a message is from, and 2) reference dependency that shows whom a message may refer to. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art on the Ubuntu IRC benchmark dataset and contributes to dialogue-related comprehension.",,,
247476252,HETERMPC: A Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Response Generation in Multi-Party Conversations,"Recently, various response generation models for two-party conversations have achieved impressive improvements, but less effort has been paid to multi-party conversations (MPCs) which are more practical and complicated. Compared with a two-party conversation where a dialogue context is a sequence of utterances, building a response generation model for MPCs is more challenging, since there exist complicated context structures and the generated responses heavily rely on both interlocutors (i.e., speaker and addressee) and history utterances. To address these challenges, we present HeterMPC, a heterogeneous graph-based neural network for response generation in MPCs which models the semantics of utterances and interlocutors simultaneously with two types of nodes in a graph. Besides, we also design six types of meta relations with node-edge-typedependent parameters to characterize the heterogeneous interactions within the graph. Through multi-hop updating, HeterMPC can adequately utilize the structural knowledge of conversations for response generation. Experimental results on the Ubuntu Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel benchmark show that HeterMPC outperforms various baseline models for response generation in MPCs.",,,
247518687,ON THE PITFALLS OF HETEROSCEDASTIC UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION WITH PROBABILISTIC NEURAL NETWORKS,"Capturing aleatoric uncertainty is a critical part of many machine learning systems. In deep learning, a common approach to this end is to train a neural network to estimate the parameters of a heteroscedastic Gaussian distribution by maximizing the logarithm of the likelihood function under the observed data. In this work, we examine this approach and identify potential hazards associated with the use of log-likelihood in conjunction with gradient-based optimizers. First, we present a synthetic example illustrating how this approach can lead to very poor but stable parameter estimates. Second, we identify the culprit to be the log-likelihood loss, along with certain conditions that exacerbate the issue. Third, we present an alternative formulation, termed β−NLL, in which each data point's contribution to the loss is weighted by the β-exponentiated variance estimate. We show that using an appropriate β largely mitigates the issue in our illustrative example. Fourth, we evaluate this approach on a range of domains and tasks and show that it achieves considerable improvements and performs more robustly concerning hyperparameters, both in predictive RMSE and log-likelihood criteria. arXiv:2203.09168v2 [cs.LG] 1 Apr 2022",,,
247519241,GLM: General Language Model Pretraining with Autoregressive Blank Infilling,"There have been various types of pretraining architectures including autoencoding models (e.g., BERT), autoregressive models (e.g., GPT), and encoder-decoder models (e.g., T5).However, none of the pretraining frameworks performs the best for all tasks of three main categories including natural language understanding (NLU), unconditional generation, and conditional generation.We propose a General Language Model (GLM) based on autoregressive blank infilling to address this challenge.GLM improves blank filling pretraining by adding 2D positional encodings and allowing an arbitrary order to predict spans, which results in performance gains over BERT and T5 on NLU tasks.Meanwhile, GLM can be pretrained for different types of tasks by varying the number and lengths of blanks.On a wide range of tasks across NLU, conditional and unconditional generation, GLM outperforms BERT, T5, and GPT given the same model sizes and data, and achieves the best performance from a single pretrained model with 1.25× parameters of BERT Large , demonstrating its generalizability to different downstream tasks. 1 * The first two authors contributed equally.† Corresponding authors.2 Unconditional generation refers to generating text as a language model without finetuning, while conditional generation refers to sequence-to-sequence tasks.",,,
247570285,DISTRIBUTIONALLY ROBUST MODELS WITH PARAMETRIC LIKELIHOOD RATIOS,"As machine learning models are deployed ever more broadly, it becomes increasingly important that they are not only able to perform well on their training distribution, but also yield accurate predictions when confronted with distribution shift. The Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) framework proposes to address this issue by training models to minimize their expected risk under a collection of distributions, to imitate test-time shifts. This is most commonly achieved by instance-level re-weighting of the training objective to emulate the likelihood ratio with possible test distributions, which allows for estimating their empirical risk via importance sampling (assuming that they are subpopulations of the training distribution). However, re-weighting schemes in the literature are usually limited due to the difficulty of keeping the optimization problem tractable and the complexity of enforcing normalization constraints. In this paper, we show that three simple ideas -mini-batch level normalization, a KL penalty and simultaneous gradient updates -allow us to train models with DRO using a broader class of parametric likelihood ratios. In a series of experiments on both image and text classification benchmarks, we find that models trained with the resulting parametric adversaries are consistently more robust to subpopulation shifts when compared to other DRO approaches, and that the method performs reliably well with little hyper-parameter tuning. 1",,,

However, the existing approaches to learning a distributionally robust model either require solving complex optimization problems such as semidefinite programming or a first-order method whose convergence scales linearly with the number of data sampleswhich hinders their scalability to large datasets. In this paper, we show how different variants of DRO are simply instances of a finite-sum composite optimization for which we provide scalable methods. We also provide empirical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm with respect to the prior art in order to learn robust models from very large datasets.",,,
247595263,SELF-CONSISTENCY IMPROVES CHAIN OF THOUGHT REASONING IN LANGUAGE MODELS,"Chain-of-thought prompting combined with pre-trained large language models has achieved encouraging results on complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose a new decoding strategy, self-consistency, to replace the naive greedy decoding used in chain-of-thought prompting. It first samples a diverse set of reasoning paths instead of only taking the greedy one, and then selects the most consistent answer by marginalizing out the sampled reasoning paths. Self-consistency leverages the intuition that a complex reasoning problem typically admits multiple different ways of thinking leading to its unique correct answer. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that self-consistency boosts the performance of chain-of-thought prompting with a striking margin on a range of popular arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K (+17.9%), SVAMP (+11.0%), AQuA (+12.2%), StrategyQA (+6.4%) and ARC-challenge (+3.9%).",,,
247595391,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 PROVABLY ROBUST ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES,"We introduce the concept of provably robust adversarial examples for deep neural networks -connected input regions constructed from standard adversarial examples which are guaranteed to be robust to a set of real-world perturbations (such as changes in pixel intensity and geometric transformations). We present a novel method called PARADE for generating these regions in a scalable manner which works by iteratively refining the region initially obtained via sampling until a refined region is certified to be adversarial with existing state-of-the-art verifiers. At each step, a novel optimization procedure is applied to maximize the region's volume under the constraint that the convex relaxation of the network behavior with respect to the region implies a chosen bound on the certification objective. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of PARADE: it successfully finds large provably robust regions including ones containing ≈ 10 573 adversarial examples for pixel intensity and ≈ 10 599 for geometric perturbations. The provability enables our robust examples to be significantly more effective against state-of-theart defenses based on randomized smoothing than the individual attacks used to construct the regions.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 cation techniques making it easily extendable to new adversarial attack models. We make the code of PARADE available at https://github.com/eth-sri/parade.git • A thorough evaluation of PARADE, demonstrating it can generate provable regions containing ≈ 10 573 concrete adversarial points for pixel intensity changes, in ≈ 2 minutes, and ≈ 10 599 concrete points for geometric transformations, in ≈ 20 minutes, on a challenging CIFAR10 network. We also demonstrate that our robust adversarial examples are significantly more effective against state-of-the-art defenses based on randomized smoothing than the individual attacks used to construct the regions.BACKGROUNDWe now discuss the background necessary for the remainder of the paper. We consider a neural network f : R n0 → R n l with l layers, n 0 input neurons and n l output classes. While our method can handle arbitrary activations, we focus on networks with the widely-used ReLU activation. The network classifies an input x to class y(x) with the largest corresponding output value, i.e.,Note for brevity we omit the argument to y when it is clear from the context.NEURAL NETWORK CERTIFICATIONIn this work, we rely on existing state-of-the-art neural network certification methods based on convex relaxations to prove that the adversarial examples produced by our algorithm are robust. These certification methods take a convex input region I ⊂ R n0 and prove that every point in I is classified as the target label y t by f . They propagate the set I through the layers of the network, producing a convex region that covers all possible values of the output neurons . Robustness follows by proving that, for all combinations of output neuron values in this region, the output neuron corresponding to class y t has a larger value than the one corresponding to any other class y = y t .Commonly, one proves this property by computing a function L y : R n0 → R for each label y = y t , such that, for all x ∈ I, we have L y (x) ≤ [f (x)] yt − [f (x)] y . For each L y , one computes min x∈I L y (x) to obtain a global lower bound that is true for all x ∈ I. If we obtain positive bounds for all y = y t , robustness is proven. To simplify notation, we will say that the certification objective L(x) is the function L y (x) with the smallest minimum value on I. We will call its corresponding minimum value the certification error. We require L y (x) to be a linear function of x. This requirement is consistent with many popular certification algorithms based on convex relaxation, such as CROWN (Zhang et al., 2018), DeepZ (Singh et al., 2018a), and DeepPoly (Singh et al., 2019). Without loss of generality, for the rest of this paper, we will treat DeepPoly as our preferred certification method.CERTIFICATION AGAINST GEOMETRIC TRANSFORMATIONSDeepPoly operates over specifications based on linear constraints over input pixels for verification. These constraints are straightforward to provide for simple pixel intensity transformations such as adversarial patches(Chiang et al., 2020)and L ∞ (Carlini & Wagner, 2017) perturbations that provide a closed-form formula for the input region. However, geometric transformations do not yield such linear regions. To prove the robustness of our generated examples to geometric transformations, we rely on DeepG (Balunović et al., 2019) which, given a range of geometric transformation parameters, creates an overapproximation of the set of input images generated by the geometric perturbations. DeepG then leverages DeepPoly to certify the input image region. When generating our geometric robust examples, we work directly in the geometric parameter space and, thus, our input region I and the inputs to our certification objective L(x) are also in geometric space. Despite this change, as our approach is agnostic to the choice of the verifier, in the remainder of the paper we will assume the certification is done using DeepPoly and not DeepG, unless otherwise stated.RANDOMIZED SMOOTHINGRandomized smoothing(Lécuyer et al., 2019;Cohen et al., 2019) is a provable defense mechanism against adversarial attacks. For a chosen standard deviation σ and neural network f as defined above, randomized smoothing computes a smoothed classifier g based on f , such that g(x) = argmax c P(y(x + ) = c) with random Gaussian noise ∼ N (0, σ 2 I). This construction of g allows",,,

Our recurrent neural network based model captures both word sequence and dependency tree substructure information by stacking bidirectional treestructured LSTM-RNNs on bidirectional sequential LSTM-RNNs. This allows our model to jointly represent both entities and relations with shared parameters in a single model. We further encourage detection of entities during training and use of entity information in relation extraction via entity pretraining and scheduled sampling. Our model improves over the stateof-the-art feature-based model on end-toend relation extraction, achieving 12.1% and 5.7% relative error reductions in F1score on ACE2005 and ACE2004, respectively.

247628080,IS FAIRNESS ONLY METRIC DEEP? EVALUATING AND ADDRESSING SUBGROUP GAPS IN DML,"Deep metric learning (DML) enables learning with less supervision through its emphasis on the similarity structure of representations. There has been much work on improving generalization of DML in settings like zero-shot retrieval, but little is known about its implications for fairness. In this paper, we are the first to evaluate state-of-the-art DML methods trained on imbalanced data, and to show the negative impact these representations have on minority subgroup performance when used for downstream tasks. In this work, we first define fairness in DML through an analysis of three properties of the representation space -interclass alignment, intra-class alignment, and uniformity -and propose finDML, the f airness in non-balanced DML benchmark to characterize representation fairness. Utilizing finDML, we find bias in DML representations to propagate to common downstream classification tasks. Surprisingly, this bias is propagated even when training data in the downstream task is re-balanced. To address this problem, we present Partial Attribute De-correlation (PARADE) to de-correlate feature representations from sensitive attributes and reduce performance gaps between subgroups in both embedding space and downstream metrics.",,,

247628166,VISION-BASED MANIPULATORS NEED TO ALSO SEE FROM THEIR HANDS,"We study how the choice of visual perspective affects learning and generalization in the context of physical manipulation from raw sensor observations. Compared with the more commonly used global third-person perspective, a hand-centric (eye-in-hand) perspective affords reduced observability, but we find that it consistently improves training efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization. These benefits hold across a variety of learning algorithms, experimental settings, and distribution shifts, and for both simulated and real robot apparatuses. However, this is only the case when hand-centric observability is sufficient; otherwise, including a third-person perspective is necessary for learning, but also harms outof-distribution generalization. To mitigate this, we propose to regularize the thirdperson information stream via a variational information bottleneck. On six representative manipulation tasks with varying hand-centric observability adapted from the Meta-World benchmark, this results in a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning agent operating from both perspectives improving its out-of-distribution generalization on every task. While some practitioners have long put cameras in the hands of robots, our work systematically analyzes the benefits of doing so and provides simple and broadly applicable insights for improving end-to-end learned vision-based robotic manipulation. 1Figure 1: Illustration suggesting the role that visual perspective can play in facilitating the acquisition of symmetries with respect to certain transformations on the world state s.

247741267,"DO USERS BENEFIT FROM INTERPRETABLE VISION? A USER STUDY, BASELINE, AND DATASET","A variety of methods exist to explain image classification models. However, it remains unclear whether they provide any benefit to users over simply comparing various inputs and the model's respective predictions. We conducted a user study (N=240) to test how such a baseline explanation technique performs against concept-based and counterfactual explanations. To this end, we contribute a synthetic dataset generator capable of biasing individual attributes and quantifying their relevance to the model. In a study, we assess if participants can identify the relevant set of attributes compared to the ground-truth. Our results show that the baseline outperformed concept-based explanations. Counterfactual explanations from an invertible neural network performed similarly as the baseline. Still, they allowed users to identify some attributes more accurately. Our results highlight the importance of measuring how well users can reason about biases of a model, rather than solely relying on technical evaluations or proxy tasks. We open-source our study and dataset so it can serve as a blue-print for future studies.",,,
247741535,TOPOLOGICAL EXPERIENCE REPLAY,"State-of-the-art deep Q-learning methods update Q-values using state transition tuples sampled from the experience replay buffer. This strategy often uniformly and randomly samples or prioritizes data sampling based on measures such as the temporal difference (TD) error. Such sampling strategies can be inefficient at learning Q-function because a state's Q-value depends on the Q-value of successor states. If the data sampling strategy ignores the precision of Q-value estimate of the next state, it can lead to useless and often incorrect updates to the Q-values. To mitigate this issue, we organize the agent's experience into a graph that explicitly tracks the dependency between Q-values of states. Each edge in the graph represents a transition between two states by executing a single action. We perform value backups via a breadth-first search starting from the set of terminal states and successively moving backwards. We empirically show that our method is substantially more data-efficient than several baselines on a diverse range of goal-reaching tasks. Notably, the proposed method also outperforms baselines that consume more batches of training experience and operates from high-dimensional observational data such as images.

To address the problems, we propose a novel model MISC, which firstly infers the user's fine-grained emotional status, and then responds skillfully using a mixture of strategy. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and reveal the benefits of fine-grained emotion understanding as well as mixed-up strategy modeling.

247922354,Structured Pruning Learns Compact and Accurate Models,"The growing size of neural language models has led to increased attention in model compression. The two predominant approaches are pruning, which gradually removes weights from a pre-trained model, and distillation, which trains a smaller compact model to match a larger one. Pruning methods can significantly reduce the model size but hardly achieve large speedups as distillation. However, distillation methods require large amounts of unlabeled data and are expensive to train. In this work, we propose a task-specific structured pruning method CoFi 1 (Coarse-and Fine-grained Pruning), which delivers highly parallelizable subnetworks and matches the distillation methods in both accuracy and latency, without resorting to any unlabeled data. Our key insight is to jointly prune coarse-grained (e.g., layers) and fine-grained (e.g., heads and hidden units) modules, which controls the pruning decision of each parameter with masks of different granularity. We also devise a layerwise distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from unpruned to pruned models during optimization. Our experiments on GLUE and SQuAD datasets show that CoFi yields models with over 10× speedups with a small accuracy drop, showing its effectiveness and efficiency compared to previous pruning and distillation approaches. 2",,,
247939641,Inverse is Better! Fast and Accurate Prompt for Few-shot Slot Tagging,"Prompting methods recently achieve impressive success in few-shot learning. These methods modify input samples with prompt sentence pieces, and decode label tokens to map samples to corresponding labels. However, such a paradigm is very inefficient for the task of slot tagging. Since slot tagging samples are multiple consecutive words in a sentence, the prompting methods have to enumerate all n-grams token spans to find all the possible slots, which greatly slows down the prediction. To tackle this, we introduce an inverse paradigm for prompting. Different from the classic prompts mapping tokens to labels, we reversely predict slot values given slot types. Such inverse prompting only requires a oneturn prediction for each slot type and greatly speeds up the prediction. Besides, we propose a novel Iterative Prediction Strategy, from which the model learns to refine predictions by considering the relations between different slot types. We find, somewhat surprisingly, the proposed method not only predicts faster but also significantly improves the effect (improve over 6.1 F1-scores on 10-shot setting) and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.",,,
247958464,Impact of Evaluation Methodologies on Code Summarization,"There has been a growing interest in developing machine learning (ML) models for code summarization tasks, e.g., comment generation and method naming. Despite substantial increase in the effectiveness of ML models, the evaluation methodologies, i.e., the way people split datasets into training, validation, and test sets, were not well studied. Specifically, no prior work on code summarization considered the timestamps of code and comments during evaluation. This may lead to evaluations that are inconsistent with the intended use cases. In this paper, we introduce the time-segmented evaluation methodology, which is novel to the code summarization research community, and compare it with the mixed-project and cross-project methodologies that have been commonly used. Each methodology can be mapped to some use cases, and the time-segmented methodology should be adopted in the evaluation of ML models for code summarization. To assess the impact of methodologies, we collect a dataset of (code, comment) pairs with timestamps to train and evaluate several recent ML models for code summarization. Our experiments show that different methodologies lead to conflicting evaluation results. We invite the community to expand the set of methodologies used in evaluations.",,,
247996737,HIGH PROBABILITY BOUNDS FOR A CLASS OF NON- CONVEX ALGORITHMS WITH ADAGRAD STEPSIZE,"In this paper, we propose a new, simplified high probability analysis of AdaGrad for smooth, non-convex problems. More specifically, we focus on a particular accelerated gradient (AGD) template (Lan, 2020), through which we recover the original AdaGrad and its variant with averaging, and prove a convergence rate of O(1/ √ T ) with high probability without the knowledge of smoothness and variance. We use a particular version of Freedman's concentration bound for martingale difference sequences (Kakade & Tewari, 2008)  which enables us to achieve the best-known dependence of log(1/δ) on the probability margin δ. We present our analysis in a modular way and obtain a complementary O(1/T ) convergence rate in the deterministic setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first high probability result for AdaGrad with a truly adaptive scheme, i.e., completely oblivious to the knowledge of smoothness and uniform variance bound, which simultaneously has best-known dependence of log(1/δ). We further prove noise adaptation property of AdaGrad under additional noise assumptions. * A Viterbi fellow Universality, adaptive methods and acceleration We call an algorithm universal if it achieves optimal rates under different settings, without any modifications. For convex minimization problems, Levy et al. (2018)  showed that AdaGrad attains a rate of O(1/T + σ/ √ T ) by implicitly adapting to smoothness and noise levels; here T is the number of oracle queries and σ is the noise variance. They also proposed an accelerated AdaGrad variant with scalar step-size. The latter result was extended for compactly constrained problems via accelerated Mirror-Prox algorithm (Kavis et al., 2019), and for composite objectives (Joulani et al., 2020). Recently, Ene et al. (2021)  have further generalized the latter results by designing a novel adaptive, accelerated algorithm with per-coordinate step-sizes. Convergence properties of such algorithms under smooth, non-convex losses are unknown to date.Adaptive methods for nonconvex optimization Following the popularity of neural networks, adaptive methods have attracted massive attention due to their favorable performance in training and their ease of tuning.

247996741,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 LAST LAYER RE-TRAINING IS SUFFICIENT FOR ROBUSTNESS TO SPURIOUS CORRELATIONS,"Neural network classifiers can largely rely on simple spurious features, such as backgrounds, to make predictions. However, even in these cases, we show that they still often learn core features associated with the desired attributes of the data, contrary to recent findings. Inspired by this insight, we demonstrate that simple last layer retraining can match or outperform state-of-the-art approaches on spurious correlation benchmarks, but with profoundly lower complexity and computational expenses. Moreover, we show that last layer retraining on large ImageNet-trained models can also significantly reduce reliance on background and texture information, improving robustness to covariate shift, after only minutes of training on a single GPU. * Equal contribution.",,,
247996981,LilNetX: Lightweight Networks with EXtreme Model Compression and Structured Sparsification,"We introduce LilNetX, an end-to-end trainable technique for neural networks that enables learning models with specified accuracy-rate-computation trade-off. Prior works approach these problems one at a time and often require post-processing or multistage training which become less practical and do not scale very well for large datasets or architectures. Our method constructs a joint training objective that penalizes the self information of network parameters in a reparameterized latent space to encourage small model size while also introducing priors to increase structured sparsity in the parameter space to reduce computation. We achieve up to 50% smaller model size and 98% model sparsity on ResNet-20 while retaining the same accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset as well as 35% smaller model size and 42% structured sparsity on ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet, when compared to existing state-of-the-art model compression methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Sharath-girish/LilNetX. Recent research in deep neural networks (DNNs) has shown that large performance gains can be achieved on a variety of computer vision tasks simply by employing larger parameter-heavy and computationally intensive architectures[13,26]. However, as the DNNs proliferate in the industry, they often need to be trained repeatedly, transmitted over the network to different devices, and need to perform under hardware constraints with minimal loss in accuracy, all at the same time. Hence, finding ways to reduce the storage size of the models on the devices while simultaneously improving their run-time is of utmost importance. This paper proposes a general purpose neural network training framework to jointly optimize the model parameters for accuracy, model size on the disk and computation, on any given task.Over the last few years, the research on training smaller and efficient DNNs has followed two seemingly parallel tracks with different goals: One line of work focuses on model compression to deal with the storage and communication network bottlenecks when deploying a large number of models over the air. While they achieve high levels of compression in terms of memory, their focus is not on reducing computation. They either require additional algorithms with some form of post hoc training[71]or quantize the network parameters at the cost of network performance[10,39]. The other line of work focuses on reducing computation through various model pruning techniques[16]. The focus of these works is to decrease the number of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) of the network at the inference time, albeit they are also able to achieve some compression due to fewer parameters. Typically, the cost of storing these pruned networks on disk is much higher than the dedicated model compression works.Preprint. Under review.",,,
248006342,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 PRETRAINING TEXT ENCODERS WITH ADVERSARIAL MIXTURE OF TRAINING SIGNAL GENERATORS,"We present a new framework AMOS that pretrains text encoders with an Adversarial learning curriculum via a Mixture Of Signals from multiple auxiliary generators. Following ELECTRA-style pretraining, the main encoder is trained as a discriminator to detect replaced tokens generated by auxiliary masked language models (MLMs). Different from ELECTRA which trains one MLM as the generator, we jointly train multiple MLMs of different sizes to provide training signals at various levels of difficulty. To push the discriminator to learn better with challenging replaced tokens, we learn mixture weights over the auxiliary MLMs' outputs to maximize the discriminator loss by backpropagating the gradient from the discriminator via Gumbel-Softmax. For better pretraining efficiency, we propose a way to assemble multiple MLMs into one unified auxiliary model. AMOS outperforms ELECTRA and recent state-of-the-art pretrained models by about 1 point on the GLUE benchmark for BERT base-sized models.Recent studies revealed that the key to the ELECTRA's success is its new learning dynamics(Xu et al., 2020;Meng et al., 2021). By pretraining the auxiliary model jointly with the main Transformer, an implicit learning curriculum is formed: The noise produced by the auxiliary generator becomes more and more plausible during pretraining, posing greater challenges for the discriminator, which has to overcome the difficulty by reasoning more deeply using the contexts. This leads to significantly improved sample efficiency and effectiveness of ELECTRA-style pretrained models(Clark et al., 2020;Chi et al., 2021;Meng et al., 2021).On the other hand, such a training dynamic also introduced new challenges in search of the optimal pretraining setting. First, the configurations of the auxiliary generator-its depth, width, and masking fraction-require costly trial-and-error pretraining runs. At the same time, they also significantly impact the discriminator's downstream task performance: A weak auxiliary model does not generate hard enough pretraining signal to push the discriminator, but a too strong one can confuse the discriminator and worsen its downstream task performance(Clark et al., 2020;Meng et al., 2021). Second, the side-by-side training of the two models forms a pseudo ""GAN-style""(Goodfellow et al., 2014)curriculum which causes difficulty to improve or scale: Previous attempts to make the generator and discriminator learning more interactive (e.g., training the generator to maximize the discriminator loss as in actual GAN frameworks) resulted in downgraded performance(Clark et al., 2020).",,,
248085573,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 NEURAL LAGRANGIAN SCHRÖDINGER BRIDGE: DIF- FUSION MODELING FOR POPULATION DYNAMICS,"Population dynamics is the study of temporal and spatial variation in the size of populations of organisms and is a major part of population ecology. One of the main difficulties in analyzing population dynamics is that we can only obtain observation data with coarse time intervals from fixed-point observations due to experimental costs or measurement constraints. Recently, modeling population dynamics by using continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and dynamic optimal transport has been proposed to infer the sample trajectories from a fixed-point observed population. While the sample behavior in CNFs is deterministic, the actual sample in biological systems moves in an essentially random yet directional manner. Moreover, when a sample moves from point A to point B in dynamical systems, its trajectory typically follows the principle of least action in which the corresponding action has the smallest possible value. To satisfy these requirements of the sample trajectories, we formulate the Lagrangian Schrödinger bridge (LSB) problem and propose to solve it approximately by modeling the advection-diffusion process with regularized neural SDE. We also develop a model architecture that enables faster computation of the loss function. Experimental results show that the proposed method can efficiently approximate the population-level dynamics even for high-dimensional data and that using the prior knowledge introduced by the Lagrangian enables us to estimate the sample-level dynamics with stochastic behavior.",,,
248118561,ReCLIP: A Strong Zero-Shot Baseline for Referring Expression Comprehension,"Training a referring expression comprehension (ReC) model for a new visual domain requires collecting referring expressions, and potentially corresponding bounding boxes, for images in the domain. While large-scale pre-trained models are useful for image classification across domains, it remains unclear if they can be applied in a zero-shot manner to more complex tasks like ReC. We present ReCLIP, a simple but strong zero-shot baseline that repurposes CLIP, a state-of-the-art large-scale model, for ReC. Motivated by the close connection between ReC and CLIP's contrastive pre-training objective, the first component of ReCLIP is a region-scoring method that isolates object proposals via cropping and blurring, and passes them to CLIP. However, through controlled experiments on a synthetic dataset, we find that CLIP is largely incapable of performing spatial reasoning off-the-shelf. Thus, the second component of ReCLIP is a spatial relation resolver that handles several types of spatial relations. We reduce the gap between zero-shot baselines from prior work and supervised models by as much as 29% on RefCOCOg, and on RefGTA (video game imagery), ReCLIP's relative improvement over supervised ReC models trained on real images is 8%. * This work was done while Sanjay, Will, and Matt were affiliated with AI2.

248177721,GAP: A Graph-aware Language Model Framework for Knowledge Graph-to-Text Generation,"Recent improvements in KG-to-text generation are due to additional auxiliary pre-training tasks designed to give the fine-tune task a boost in performance. These tasks require extensive computational resources while only suggesting marginal improvements. Here, we demonstrate that by fusing graph-aware elements into existing pre-trained language models, we are able to outperform state-of-the-art models and close the gap imposed by additional pre-training tasks. We do so by proposing a mask structure to capture neighborhood information and a novel type encoder that adds a bias to the graphattention weights depending on the connection type. Experiments on two KG-to-text benchmark datasets show our models are competitive while involving fewer parameters and no additional pre-training tasks. By formulating the problem as a framework, we can interchange the various proposed components and begin interpreting KG-to-text generative models based on the topological and type information found in a graph.",,,

DiffCSE learns sentence embeddings that are sensitive to the difference between the original sentence and an edited sentence, where the edited sentence is obtained by stochastically masking out the original sentence and then sampling from a masked language model. We show that DiffSCE is an instance of equivariant contrastive learning (Dangovski et al., 2021), which generalizes contrastive learning and learns representations that are insensitive to certain types of augmentations and sensitive to other ""harmful"" types of augmentations. Our experiments show that DiffCSE achieves state-of-the-art results among unsupervised sentence representation learning methods, outperforming unsupervised SimCSE 1 by 2.3 absolute points on semantic textual similarity tasks. 2",,,
248496439,Debiased Contrastive Learning of Unsupervised Sentence Representations,"Recently, contrastive learning has been shown to be effective in improving pre-trained language models (PLM) to derive high-quality sentence representations. It aims to pull close positive examples to enhance the alignment while push apart irrelevant negatives for the uniformity of the whole representation space. However, previous works mostly adopt in-batch negatives or sample from training data at random. Such a way may cause the sampling bias that improper negatives (e.g., false negatives and anisotropy representations) are used to learn sentence representations, which will hurt the uniformity of the representation space. To address it, we present a new framework DCLR (Debiased Contrastive Learning of unsupervised sentence Representations) to alleviate the influence of these improper negatives. In DCLR, we design an instance weighting method to punish false negatives and generate noise-based negatives to guarantee the uniformity of the representation space. Experiments on seven semantic textual similarity tasks show that our approach is more effective than competitive baselines.

248512463,"Same Neurons, Different Languages: Probing Morphosyntax in Multilingual Pre-trained Models","The success of multilingual pre-trained models is underpinned by their ability to learn representations shared by multiple languages even in absence of any explicit supervision. However, it remains unclear how these models learn to generalise across languages. In this work, we conjecture that multilingual pretrained models can derive language-universal abstractions about grammar. In particular, we investigate whether morphosyntactic information is encoded in the same subset of neurons in different languages. We conduct the first large-scale empirical study over 43 languages and 14 morphosyntactic categories with a state-of-the-art neuron-level probe. Our findings show that the cross-lingual overlap between neurons is significant, but its extent may vary across categories and depends on language proximity and pre-training data size.",,,
248512647,Non-Autoregressive Machine Translation: It's Not as Fast as it Seems,"Efficient machine translation models are commercially important as they can increase inference speeds, and reduce costs and carbon emissions. Recently, there has been much interest in non-autoregressive (NAR) models, which promise faster translation. In parallel to the research on NAR models, there have been successful attempts to create optimized autoregressive models as part of the WMT shared task on efficient translation. In this paper, we point out flaws in the evaluation methodology present in the literature on NAR models and we provide a fair comparison between a stateof-the-art NAR model and the autoregressive submissions to the shared task. We make the case for consistent evaluation of NAR models, and also for the importance of comparing NAR models with other widely used methods for improving efficiency. We run experiments with a connectionist-temporal-classification-based (CTC) NAR model implemented in C++ and compare it with AR models using wall clock times. Our results show that, although NAR models are faster on GPUs, with small batch sizes, they are almost always slower under more realistic usage conditions. We call for more realistic and extensive evaluation of NAR models in future work.",,,

During a conversation involving various people, a person's emotions are influenced by the other speaker's utterances and their own emotional state over the utterances. In this paper, we propose COntextualized Graph Neural Network based Multimodal Emotion recognitioN (COGMEN) system that leverages local information (i.e., inter/intra dependency between speakers) and global information (context). The proposed model uses Graph Neural Network (GNN) based architecture to model the complex dependencies (local and global information) in a conversation. Our model gives state-of-theart (SOTA) results on IEMOCAP and MOSEI datasets, and detailed ablation experiments show the importance of modeling information at both levels.",,,
248693452,Extracting Latent Steering Vectors from Pretrained Language Models,"Prior work on controllable text generation has focused on learning how to control language models through trainable decoding, smartprompt design, or fine-tuning based on a desired objective. We hypothesize that the information needed to steer the model to generate a target sentence is already encoded within the model. Accordingly, we explore a different approach altogether: extracting latent vectors directly from pretrained language model decoders without fine-tuning. Experiments show that there exist steering vectors, which, when added to the hidden states of the language model, generate a target sentence nearly perfectly (> 99 BLEU) for English sentences from a variety of domains. We show that vector arithmetic can be used for unsupervised sentiment transfer on the Yelp sentiment benchmark, with performance comparable to models tailored to this task. We find that distances between steering vectors reflect sentence similarity when evaluated on a textual similarity benchmark (STS-B), outperforming pooled hidden states of models. Finally, we present an analysis of the intrinsic properties of the steering vectors. Taken together, our results suggest that frozen LMs can be effectively controlled through their latent steering space. 1",,,
248693515,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 RISP: RENDERING-INVARIANT STATE PREDICTOR WITH DIFFERENTIABLE SIMULATION AND RENDER- ING FOR CROSS-DOMAIN PARAMETER ESTIMATION,"This work considers identifying parameters characterizing a physical system's dynamic motion directly from a video whose rendering configurations are inaccessible. Existing solutions require massive training data or lack generalizability to unknown rendering configurations. We propose a novel approach that marries domain randomization and differentiable rendering gradients to address this problem. Our core idea is to train a rendering-invariant state-prediction (RISP) network that transforms image differences into state differences independent of rendering configurations, e.g., lighting, shadows, or material reflectance. To train this predictor, we formulate a new loss on rendering variances using gradients from differentiable rendering. Moreover, we present an efficient, second-order method to compute the gradients of this loss, allowing it to be integrated seamlessly into modern deep learning frameworks. We evaluate our method in rigid-body and deformable-body simulation environments using four tasks: state estimation, system identification, imitation learning, and visuomotor control. We further demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a real-world example: inferring the state and action sequences of a quadrotor from a video of its motion sequences. Compared with existing methods, our approach achieves significantly lower reconstruction errors and has better generalizability among unknown rendering configurations 1 . * Equal contribution 1 Videos, code, and data are available on the project webpage:",,,
248721770,Lifting the Curse of Multilinguality by Pre-training Modular Transformers,"Multilingual pre-trained models are known to suffer from the curse of multilinguality, which causes per-language performance to drop as they cover more languages. We address this issue by introducing language-specific modules, which allows us to grow the total capacity of the model, while keeping the total number of trainable parameters per language constant. In contrast with prior work that learns languagespecific components post-hoc, we pre-train the modules of our Cross-lingual Modular (X-MOD) models from the start. Our experiments on natural language inference, named entity recognition and question answering show that our approach not only mitigates the negative interference between languages, but also enables positive transfer, resulting in improved monolingual and cross-lingual performance. Furthermore, our approach enables adding languages post-hoc with no measurable drop in performance, no longer limiting the model usage to the set of pre-trained languages.",,,
248779910,Rare and Zero-shot Word Sense Disambiguation using Z-Reweighting,"Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is a crucial problem in the natural language processing (NLP) community. Current methods achieve decent performance by utilizing supervised learning and large pre-trained language models. However, the imbalanced training dataset leads to poor performance on rare senses and zero-shot senses. There are more training instances and senses for words with top frequency ranks than those with low frequency ranks in the training dataset. We investigate the statistical relation between word frequency rank and word sense number distribution. Based on the relation, we propose a Z-reweighting method on the word level to adjust the training on the imbalanced dataset. The experiments show that the Z-reweighting strategy achieves performance gain on the standard English all words WSD benchmark. Moreover, the strategy can help models generalize better on rare and zero-shot senses.",,,
248779939,Learn and Review: Enhancing Continual Named Entity Recognition via Reviewing Synthetic Samples,"Traditional methods for named entity recognition (NER) classify mentions into a fixed set of pre-defined entity types. However, in many real-world scenarios, new entity types are incrementally involved. To investigate this problem, continual learning is introduced for NER. However, the existing method depends on the relevance between tasks and is prone to inter-type confusion. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework Learn-and-Review (L&R) for continual NER under the type-incremental setting to alleviate the above issues. Specifically, for the learning stage, we distill the old knowledge from teacher to a student on the current dataset. For the reviewing stage, we first generate synthetic samples of old types to augment the dataset. Then, we further distill new knowledge from the above student and old knowledge from the teacher to get an enhanced student on the augmented dataset. This stage has the following advantages: (1) The synthetic samples mitigate the gap between the old and new task and thus enhance the further distillation; (2) Different types of entities are jointly seen during training which alleviates the inter-type confusion. Experimental results show that L&R outperforms the state-of-the-art method on CoNLL-03 and OntoNotes-5.0.",,,
248780177,P-Tuning: Prompt Tuning Can Be Comparable to Fine-tuning Across Scales and Tasks,"Prompt tuning, which only tunes continuous prompts with a frozen language model, substantially reduces per-task storage and memory usage at training. However, in the context of NLU, prior work reveals that prompt tuning does not perform well for normal-sized pretrained models. We also find that existing methods of prompt tuning cannot handle hard sequence labeling tasks, indicating a lack of universality. We present a novel empirical finding that properly optimized prompt tuning can be universally effective across a wide range of model scales and NLU tasks. It matches the performance of finetuning while having only 0.1%-3% tuned parameters. Our method P-Tuning v2 is an implementation of Deep Prompt Tuning(Li and Liang, 2021;Qin and Eisner, 2021)optimized and adapted for NLU. Given the universality and simplicity of P-Tuning v2, we believe it can serve as an alternative to finetuning and a strong baseline for future research. 1",,,

Unlike data augmentation for other tasks such as sentence-level and sentence-pair ones, data augmentation for named entity recognition (NER) requires preserving the semantic of entities. To that end, in this paper we propose a simple semantic-based data augmentation method for biomedical NER. Our method leverages semantic information from pre-trained language models for both entity-level and sentence-level.

248780440,Auto-Debias: Debiasing Masked Language Models with Automated Biased Prompts,"Human-like biases and undesired social stereotypes exist in large pretrained language models. Given the wide adoption of these models in real-world applications, mitigating such biases has become an emerging and important task. In this paper, we propose an automatic method to mitigate the biases in pretrained language models. Different from previous debiasing work that uses external corpora to finetune the pretrained models, we instead directly probe the biases encoded in pretrained models through prompts. Specifically, we propose a variant of the beam search method to automatically search for biased prompts such that the cloze-style completions are the most different with respect to different demographic groups. Given the identified biased prompts, we then propose a distribution alignment loss to mitigate the biases. Experiment results on standard datasets and metrics show that our proposed Auto-Debias approach can significantly reduce biases, including gender and racial bias, in pretrained language models such as BERT, RoBERTa and ALBERT. Moreover, the improvement in fairness does not decrease the language models' understanding abilities, as shown using the GLUE benchmark.",,,
248780467,Interactive Latent Knowledge Selection for E-commerce Product Copywriting Generation,"As the multi-modal e-commerce is thriving, high-quality advertising product copywriting has gain more attentions, which plays a crucial role in the e-commerce recommender, advertising and even search platforms. The advertising product copywriting is able to enhance the user experience by highlighting the product's characteristics with textual descriptions and thus to improve the likelihood of user click and purchase. Automatically generating product copywriting has attracted noticeable interests from both academic and industrial communities, where existing solutions merely make use of a product's title and attribute information to generate its corresponding description. However, in addition to the product title and attributes, we observe that there are various auxiliary descriptions created by the shoppers or marketers in the ecommerce platforms (namely human knowledge), which contains valuable information for product copywriting generation, yet always accompanying lots of noises. In this work, we propose a novel solution to automatically generating product copywriting that involves all the title, attributes and denoised auxiliary knowledge. To be specific, we design an end-to-end generation framework equipped with two variational autoencoders that works interactively to select informative human knowledge and generate diverse copywriting. Experiments on real-world e-commerce product copywriting datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms various baselines with regard to both automatic and human evaluation metrics.",,,

We collect non-toxic paraphrases for over 10,000 English toxic sentences. We also show that this pipeline can be used to distill a large existing corpus of paraphrases to get toxicneutral sentence pairs. We release two parallel corpora which can be used for the training of detoxification models. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first parallel datasets for this task. We describe our pipeline in detail to make it fast to set up for a new language or domain, thus contributing to faster and easier development of new parallel resources.We train several detoxification models on the collected data and compare them with several baselines and state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches. We conduct both automatic and manual evaluations. All models trained on parallel data outperform the state-of-the-art unsupervised models by a large margin. This suggests that our novel datasets can boost the performance of detoxification systems.",,,
248780580,Fully-Semantic Parsing and Generation: the BabelNet Meaning Representation,"A language-independent representation of meaning is one of the most coveted dreams in Natural Language Understanding. With this goal in mind, several formalisms have been proposed as frameworks for meaning representation in Semantic Parsing. And yet, the dependencies these formalisms share with respect to language-specific repositories of knowledge make the objective of closing the gap between high-and low-resourced languages hard to accomplish. In this paper, we present the Ba-belNet Meaning Representation (BMR), an interlingual formalism that abstracts away from language-specific constraints by taking advantage of the multilingual semantic resources of BabelNet and VerbAtlas. We describe the rationale behind the creation of BMR and put forward BMR 1.0, a dataset labeled entirely according to the new formalism. Moreover, we show how BMR is able to outperform previous formalisms thanks to its fully-semantic framing, which enables top-notch multilingual parsing and generation.

248887351,Selection-Inference: Exploiting Large Language Models for Interpretable Logical Reasoning,"Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be capable of impressive few-shot generalisation to new tasks. However, they still tend to perform poorly on multi-step logical reasoning problems. Here we carry out a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs on 50 tasks that probe different aspects of logical reasoning. We show that language models tend to perform fairly well at single step inference or entailment tasks, but struggle to chain together multiple reasoning steps to solve more complex problems. In light of this, we propose a Selection-Inference (SI) framework that exploits pre-trained LLMs as general processing modules, and alternates between selection and inference to generate a series of interpretable, casual reasoning steps leading to the final answer. We show that a 7B parameter LLM used within the SI framework in a 5-shot generalisation setting, with no fine-tuning, yields a performance improvement of over 100% compared to an equivalent vanilla baseline on a suite of 10 logical reasoning tasks. The same model in the same setting even outperforms a significantly larger 280B parameter baseline on the same suite of tasks. Moreover, answers produced by the SI framework are accompanied by a causal natural-language-based reasoning trace, which has important implications for the safety and trustworthiness of the system.",,,

Using this learned metric, we can nonlinearly interpolate between probability measures and compute geodesics on the manifold. We show that metrics learned using our method improve the quality of trajectory inference on scRNA and bird migration data at the cost of little additional cross-sectional data.",,,
249062579,,"The propensity of abstractive summarization models to make factual errors has been studied extensively, including design of metrics to detect factual errors and annotation of errors in current systems' outputs. However, the everevolving nature of summarization systems, metrics, and annotated benchmarks makes factuality evaluation a moving target, and drawing clear comparisons among metrics has become increasingly difficult. In this work, we aggregate factuality error annotations from nine existing datasets and stratify them according to the underlying summarization model. We compare performance of state-of-the-art factuality metrics, including recent ChatGPT-based metrics, on this stratified benchmark and show that their performance varies significantly across different types of summarization models. Critically, our analysis shows that much of the recent improvement in the factuality detection space has been on summaries from older (pre-Transformer) models instead of more relevant recent summarization models. We further perform a finer-grained analysis per error-type and find similar performance variance across error types for different factuality metrics. Our results show that no one metric is superior in all settings or for all error types, and we provide recommendations for best practices given these insights. 1",,,
249062748,Generating Natural Language Proofs with Verifier-Guided Search,"Reasoning over natural language is a challenging problem in NLP. In this work, we focus on proof generation: Given a hypothesis and a set of supporting facts, the model generates a proof tree indicating how to derive the hypothesis from supporting facts. Compared to generating the entire proof in one shot, stepwise generation can better exploit the compositionality and generalize to longer proofs but has achieved limited success on real-world data. Existing stepwise methods struggle to generate proof steps that are both logically valid and relevant to the hypothesis. Instead, they tend to hallucinate invalid steps given the hypothesis. In this paper, we present a novel stepwise method, NLProofS (Natural Language Proof Search), which learns to generate relevant steps conditioning on the hypothesis. At the core of our approach, we train an independent verifier to check the validity of the proof steps to prevent hallucination. Instead of generating steps greedily, we search for proofs maximizing a global proof score judged by the verifier. NL-ProofS achieves state-of-the-art performance on EntailmentBank and RuleTaker. Specifically, it improves the correctness of predicted proofs from 27.7% to 33.3% in the distractor setting of EntailmentBank, demonstrating the effectiveness of NLProofS in generating challenging human-authored proofs. 1",,,
249062918,Large Language Models are Few-Shot Clinical Information Extractors,"A long-running goal of the clinical NLP community is the extraction of important variables trapped in clinical notes. However, roadblocks have included dataset shift from the general domain and a lack of public clinical corpora and annotations. In this work, we show that large language models, such as InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), perform well at zero-and few-shot information extraction from clinical text despite not being trained specifically for the clinical domain. Whereas text classification and generation performance have already been studied extensively in such models, here we additionally demonstrate how to leverage them to tackle a diverse set of NLP tasks which require more structured outputs, including span identification, token-level sequence classification, and relation extraction. Further, due to the dearth of available data to evaluate these systems, we introduce new datasets for benchmarking fewshot clinical information extraction based on a manual re-annotation of the CASI dataset (Moon et al., 2014) for new tasks 1 .

249151916,PREDICTOR-CORRECTOR ALGORITHMS FOR STOCHAS- TIC OPTIMIZATION UNDER GRADUAL DISTRIBUTION SHIFT,"Time-varying stochastic optimization problems frequently arise in machine learning practice (e.g. gradual domain shift, object tracking, strategic classification). Often, the underlying process that drives the distribution shift is continuous in nature. We exploit this underlying continuity by developing predictor-corrector algorithms for time-varying stochastic optimization that anticipates changes in the underlying data generating process through a predictor-corrector term in the update rule. The key challenge is the estimation of the predictor-corrector term; a naive approach based on sample-average approximation may lead to non-convergence. We develop a general moving-average based method to estimate the predictorcorrector term and provide error bounds for the iterates, both in presence of pure and noisy access to the queries from the relevant derivatives of the loss function. Furthermore, we show (theoretically and empirically in several examples) that our method outperforms non-predictor corrector methods that do not anticipate changes in the data generating process. 1",,,
249151979,Semeval-2022 Task 1: CODWOE -Comparing Dictionaries and Word Embeddings,"Word embeddings have advanced the state of the art in NLP across numerous tasks. Understanding the contents of dense neural representations is of utmost interest to the computational semantics community. We propose to focus on relating these opaque word vectors with human-readable definitions, as found in dictionaries. This problem naturally divides into two subtasks: converting definitions into embeddings, and converting embeddings into definitions. This task was conducted in a multilingual setting, using comparable sets of embeddings trained homogeneously.",,,
249191952,Divide to Adapt: Mitigating Confirmation Bias for Domain Adaptation of Black-Box Predictors,"Domain Adaptation of Black-box Predictors (DABP) aims to learn a model on an unlabeled target domain supervised by a black-box predictor trained on a source domain. It does not require access to both the source-domain data and the predictor parameters, thus addressing the data privacy and portability issues of standard domain adaptation. Existing DABP approaches mostly rely on model distillation from the black-box predictor, i.e., training the model with its noisy target-domain predictions, which however inevitably introduces the confirmation bias accumulated from the prediction noises. To mitigate such bias, we propose a new method, named BETA, to incorporate knowledge distillation and noisy label learning into one coherent framework. This is enabled by a new divide-to-adapt strategy. BETA divides the target domain into an easy-to-adapt subdomain with less noise and a hard-to-adapt subdomain. Then it deploys mutually-teaching twin networks to filter the predictor errors for each other and improve them progressively, from the easy to hard subdomains. As such, BETA effectively purifies the noisy labels and reduces error accumulation. We theoretically show that the target error of BETA is minimized by decreasing the noise ratio of the subdomains. Extensive experiments demonstrate BETA outperforms existing methods on all DABP benchmarks, and is even comparable with the standard domain adaptation methods that use the source-domain data.",,,
249209856,Fooling SHAP with Stealthily Biased Sampling,"SHAP explanations aim at identifying which features contribute the most to the difference in model prediction at a specific input versus a background distribution. Recent studies have shown that they can be manipulated by malicious adversaries to produce arbitrary desired explanations. However, existing attacks focus solely on altering the black-box model itself. In this paper, we propose a complementary family of attacks that leave the model intact and manipulate SHAP explanations using stealthily biased sampling of the data points used to approximate expectations w.r.t the background distribution. In the context of fairness audit, we show that our attack can reduce the importance of a sensitive feature when explaining the difference in outcomes between groups, while remaining undetected. These results highlight the manipulability of SHAP explanations and encourage auditors to treat post-hoc explanations with skepticism. Recently, several studies reported that such a manipulation is possible, e.g. by modifying the Preprint. Under review.",,,
249209990,POST-HOC CONCEPT BOTTLENECK MODELS,"Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) map the inputs onto a set of interpretable concepts (""the bottleneck"") and use the concepts to make predictions. A concept bottleneck enhances interpretability since it can be investigated to understand what concepts the model ""sees"" in an input and which of these concepts are deemed important. However, CBMs are restrictive in practice as they require dense concept annotations in the training data to learn the bottleneck. Moreover, CBMs often do not match the accuracy of an unrestricted neural network, reducing the incentive to deploy them in practice. In this work, we address these limitations of CBMs by introducing Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck models (PCBMs). We show that we can turn any neural network into a PCBM without sacrificing model performance while still retaining the interpretability benefits. When concept annotations are not available on the training data, we show that PCBM can transfer concepts from other datasets or from natural language descriptions of concepts via multimodal models. A key benefit of PCBM is that it enables users to quickly debug and update the model to reduce spurious correlations and improve generalization to new distributions. PCBM allows for global model edits, which can be more efficient than previous works on local interventions that fix a specific prediction. Through a model-editing user study, we show that editing PCBMs via conceptlevel feedback can provide significant performance gains without using data from the target domain or model retraining. The code for our paper can be found in https://github.com/mertyg/post-hoc-cbm. arXiv:2205.15480v2 [cs.LG] 1 Feb 2023 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 2. Performance: CBMs often do not match the accuracy of an unrestricted model, potentially reducing the incentive to use them in practice. When the concepts are not enough to solve the desired task, it is not clear how to improve the CBM and match the original model performance, while retaining the interpretability benefits. 3. Model editing: Koh et al. (2020) discuss intervening on the model to fix the prediction for a singleinput, yet it is not shown how to holistically edit and improve the model itself. Intervening only changes the model behavior for a single sample, but global editing changes the model behavior completely. When the model picks up an unintended cue, or learns spurious associations, using the latter approach and editing the concept bottleneck can improve the model performance more generally than an intervention tailored toward one specific input. Prior work on CBMs does not discuss how to globally edit a model's behavior. Ideally, we would like to edit models with the help of human input in order to lower computational costs and remove assumptions about data access.Our contributions. In this work, we propose the Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck Model (PCBM) to address these important challenges. PCBMs can convert any pre-trained model into a concept bottleneck model in a data-efficient manner, and enhance the model with the desired interpretability benefits. When the training data does not have concept annotations, which is often the case, PCBM can flexibly leverage concepts annotated in other datasets and natural language descriptions of concepts. When applicable, PCBMs can remove the laborious concept annotation process by leveraging multimodal models to obtain concept representations; this results in richer and more expressive bottlenecks using natural language descriptions of a concept, making PCBMs more accessible in various settings. Furthermore, when the available concepts are not sufficiently rich, we introduce a residual modeling step to the PCBM to recover the original blackbox model's performance. In experiments across several tasks, we show that PCBMs can be used with comparable performance compared to black-box models. While prior work(Koh et al., 2020)demonstrated the possibility of performing local model interventions to change individual predictions, here we propose interventions for changing global model behavior. Through user studies, we show that PCBM enables efficient global model edits without retraining or access to data from the target domain and that users can improve PCBM performance by using concept-level feedback to drive editing decisions.",,,
249395483,Asymptotic Instance-Optimal Algorithms for Interactive Decision Making,"Past research on interactive decision making problems (bandits, reinforcement learning, etc.) mostly focuses on the minimax regret that measures the algorithm's performance on the hardest instance. However, an ideal algorithm should adapt to the complexity of a particular problem instance and incur smaller regrets on easy instances than worst-case instances. In this paper, we design the first asymptotic instance-optimal algorithm for general interactive decision making problems with finite number of decisions under mild conditions. On every instance f , our algorithm outperforms all consistent algorithms (those achieving non-trivial regrets on all instances), and has asymptotic regret C(f ) ln n, where C(f ) is an exact characterization of the complexity of f . The key step of the algorithm involves hypothesis testing with active data collection. It computes the most economical decisions with which the algorithm collects observations to test whether an estimated instance is indeed correct; thus, the complexity C(f ) is the minimum cost to test the instance f against other instances. Our results, instantiated on concrete problems, recover the classical gap-dependent bounds for multi-armed bandits [Lai et al., 1985]  and prior works on linear bandits [Lattimore and Szepesvari, 2017], and improve upon the previous best instance-dependent upper bound [Xu et al., 2021] for reinforcement learning. , et al.

249395677,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 ON THE DUALITY BETWEEN CONTRASTIVE AND NON- CONTRASTIVE SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING,"Recent approaches in self-supervised learning of image representations can be categorized into different families of methods and, in particular, can be divided into contrastive and non-contrastive approaches. While differences between the two families have been thoroughly discussed to motivate new approaches, we focus more on the theoretical similarities between them. By designing contrastive and covariance based non-contrastive criteria that can be related algebraically and shown to be equivalent under limited assumptions, we show how close those families can be. We further study popular methods and introduce variations of them, allowing us to relate this theoretical result to current practices and show the influence (or lack thereof) of design choices on downstream performance. Motivated by our equivalence result, we investigate the low performance of SimCLR and show how it can match VICReg's with careful hyperparameter tuning, improving significantly over known baselines. We also challenge the popular assumption that non-contrastive methods need large output dimensions. Our theoretical and quantitative results suggest that the numerical gaps between contrastive and noncontrastive methods in certain regimes can be closed given better network design choices and hyperparameter tuning. The evidence shows that unifying different SOTA methods is an important direction to build a better understanding of selfsupervised learning. , in no particular order, for insightful discussions.

249431866,Revealing Single Frame Bias for Video-and-Language Learning,"Training an effective video-and-language model intuitively requires multiple frames as model inputs. However, it is unclear whether using multiple frames is beneficial to downstream tasks, and if yes, whether the performance gain is worth the drastically-increased computation and memory costs resulting from using more frames. In this work, we explore single-frame models for video-and-language learning. On a diverse set of video-andlanguage tasks (including text-to-video retrieval and video question answering), we show the surprising result that, with large-scale pretraining and a proper frame ensemble strategy at inference time, a single-frame trained model that does not consider temporal information can achieve better performance than existing methods that use multiple frames for training. This result reveals the existence of a strong ""static appearance bias"" in popular video-andlanguage datasets. Therefore, to allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of videoand-language models, we propose two new retrieval tasks based on existing fine-grained action recognition datasets that encourage temporal modeling.

249538336,ESCHER: ESCHEWING IMPORTANCE SAMPLING IN GAMES BY COMPUTING A HISTORY VALUE FUNCTION TO ESTIMATE REGRET,"Recent techniques for approximating Nash equilibria in very large games leverage neural networks to learn approximately optimal policies (strategies). One promising line of research uses neural networks to approximate counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) or its modern variants. DREAM, the only current CFR-based neural method that is model free and therefore scalable to very large games, trains a neural network on an estimated regret target that can have extremely high variance due to an importance sampling term inherited from Monte Carlo CFR (MCCFR). In this paper we propose an unbiased model-free method that does not require any importance sampling. Our method, ESCHER, is principled and is guaranteed to converge to an approximate Nash equilibrium with high probability. We show that the variance of the estimated regret of ESCHER is orders of magnitude lower than DREAM and other baselines. We then show that ESCHER outperforms the prior state of the art-DREAM and neural fictitious self play (NFSP)-on a number of games and the difference becomes dramatic as game size increases. In the very large game of dark chess, ESCHER is able to beat DREAM and NFSP in a head-to-head competition over 90% of the time.",,,

But a general solution to this motif-scaffolding problem remains open. Current machine-learning techniques for scaffold design are either limited to unrealistically small scaffolds (up to length 20) or struggle to produce multiple diverse scaffolds. We propose to learn a distribution over diverse and longer protein backbone structures via an E(3)equivariant graph neural network. We develop SMCDiff to efficiently sample scaffolds from this distribution conditioned on a given motif; our algorithm is the first to theoretically guarantee conditional samples from a diffusion model in the largecompute limit. We evaluate our designed backbones by how well they align with AlphaFold2-predicted structures.

Current explanation approaches rely on attention values or input gradients, but these provide a limited view of a model's dependencies. Shapley values offer a theoretically sound alternative, but their computational cost makes them impractical for large, high-dimensional models. In this work, we aim to make Shapley values practical for vision transformers (ViTs). To do so, we first leverage an attention masking approach to evaluate ViTs with partial information, and we then develop a procedure to generate Shapley value explanations via a separate, learned explainer model. Our experiments compare Shapley values to many baseline methods (e.g., attention rollout, GradCAM, LRP), and we find that our approach provides more accurate explanations than existing methods for ViTs. * Equal contribution.",,,

This can make these methods labor-intensive and dataset-specific. To address these shortcomings, we present a scalable method for automatically distilling a model's failure modes. Specifically, we harness linear classifiers to identify consistent error patterns, and, in turn, induce a natural representation of these failure modes as directions within the feature space. We demonstrate that this framework allows us to discover and automatically caption challenging subpopulations within the training dataset. Moreover, by combining our framework with off-the-shelf diffusion models, we can generate images that are especially challenging for the analyzed model, and thus can be used to perform synthetic data augmentation that helps remedy the model's failure modes.",,,
250390500,ACTUNE: Uncertainty-Based Active Self-Training for Active Fine-Tuning of Pretrained Language Models,"While pre-trained language model (PLM) finetuning has achieved strong performance in many NLP tasks, the fine-tuning stage can be still demanding in labeled data. Recent works have resorted to active fine-tuning to improve the label efficiency of PLM fine-tuning, but none of them investigate the potential of unlabeled data. We propose ACTUNE, a new framework that leverages unlabeled data to improve the label efficiency of active PLM fine-tuning. ACTUNE switches between data annotation and model self-training based on uncertainty: it selects high-uncertainty unlabeled samples for active annotation and lowuncertainty ones for model self-training. Under this framework, we design (1) a regionaware sampling strategy that reduces redundancy when actively querying for annotations and (2) a momentum-based memory bank that dynamically aggregates the model's pseudo labels to suppress label noise in self-training. Experiments on 6 text classification datasets show that ACTUNE outperforms the strongest active learning and self-training baselines and improves the label efficiency of PLM finetuning by 56.2% on average.

250390946,Knowledge Transfer between Structured and Unstructured Sources for Complex Question Answering,"Multi-hop question answering (QA) combines multiple pieces of evidence to search for the correct answer. Reasoning over a text corpus (TextQA) and/or a knowledge base (KBQA) has been extensively studied and led to distinct system architectures. However, knowledge transfer between such two QA systems has been under-explored. Research questions like what knowledge is transferred or whether the transferred knowledge can help answer over one source using another one, are yet to be answered. In this paper, therefore, we study the knowledge transfer of multi-hop reasoning between structured and unstructured sources. We first propose a unified QA framework named SIMULTQA to enable knowledge transfer and bridge the distinct supervisions from KB and text sources. Then, we conduct extensive analyses to explore how knowledge is transferred by leveraging the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. We focus on the low-resource finetuning to show that pre-training SIMULTQA on one source can substantially improve its performance on the other source. More fine-grained analyses on transfer behaviors reveal the types of transferred knowledge and transfer patterns. We conclude with insights into how to construct better QA datasets and systems to exploit knowledge transfer for future work.",,,

251320393,ZEROFL: EFFICIENT ON-DEVICE TRAINING FOR FEDERATED LEARNING WITH LOCAL SPARSITY,"When the available hardware cannot meet the memory and compute requirements to efficiently train high performing machine learning models, a compromise in either the training quality or the model complexity is needed. In Federated Learning (FL), nodes are orders of magnitude more constrained than traditional servergrade hardware and are often battery powered, severely limiting the sophistication of models that can be trained under this paradigm. While most research has focused on designing better aggregation strategies to improve convergence rates and in alleviating the communication costs of FL, fewer efforts have been devoted to accelerating on-device training. Such stage, which repeats hundreds of times (i.e. every round) and can involve thousands of devices, accounts for the majority of the time required to train federated models and, the totality of the energy consumption at the client side. In this work, we present the first study on the unique aspects that arise when introducing sparsity at training time in FL workloads. We then propose ZeroFL, a framework that relies on highly sparse operations to accelerate on-device training. Models trained with ZeroFL and 95% sparsity achieve up to 2.3% higher accuracy compared to competitive baselines obtained from adapting a state-of-the-art sparse training framework to the FL setting.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 this way overall device utilization (e.g. fewer local epochs) and number of communication rounds. Other optimization techniques such as quantization and sparsity have been used in the context of FL but mostly as a way to reduce communication costs(Liu et al., 2021;Amiri et al., 2020;Shahid et al., 2021)but not to accelerate on-device training.The use of sparse operations (e.g. convolutions) at training time has recently been shown to be an effective technique to accelerate training in centralised settingsGoli & Aamodt, 2020;Raihan & Aamodt, 2020). The resulting models are as good or close to their densely-trained counterparts despite reducing by up to 90% their FLOPs budget and, resulting in an overall up to 3.3× training speedup. Acceleration is achieved by performing sparse convolutions during the forward and/or backward pass, which requires at least one of the operands (i.e. inputs, weights, gradients) to be sufficiently sparse and, software and hardware support for such operations. However, it is unclear how the different FL-specific challenges (i.e. data imbalance, stateless clients, periodic aggregation) will restrict the quality of the global model. This work considers the challenges and opportunities of inducing high levels of sparsity to accelerate training on-device for FL workloads, and provides the following contributions:• The first framework for Federated Learning that leverages sparsity as a mechanism to accelerate on-device training by inducing up to 95% sparse weights and activations.

251554821,DIFFUSION POLICIES AS AN EXPRESSIVE POLICY CLASS FOR OFFLINE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING,"Offline reinforcement learning (RL), which aims to learn an optimal policy using a previously collected static dataset, is an important paradigm of RL. Standard RL methods often perform poorly in this regime due to the function approximation errors on out-of-distribution actions. While a variety of regularization methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, they are often constrained by policy classes with limited expressiveness that can lead to highly suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose representing the policy as a diffusion model, a recent class of highly-expressive deep generative models. We introduce Diffusion Qlearning (Diffusion-QL) that utilizes a conditional diffusion model to represent the policy. In our approach, we learn an action-value function and we add a term maximizing action-values into the training loss of the conditional diffusion model, which results in a loss that seeks optimal actions that are near the behavior policy. We show the expressiveness of the diffusion model-based policy, and the coupling of the behavior cloning and policy improvement under the diffusion model both contribute to the outstanding performance of Diffusion-QL. We illustrate the superiority of our method compared to prior works in a simple 2D bandit example with a multimodal behavior policy. We then show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the majority of the D4RL benchmark tasks. * The work was done in part during a summer internship at Twitter. † Joint senior authors; order determined by flipping a coin. arXiv:2208.06193v3 [cs.LG] 25 Aug 2023Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023ICLR     et al., 2020Yu et al., 2021); 4) treating offline RL as a problem of sequence prediction with return guidance (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021;. Our approach falls into the first category.Empirically, the performance of policy-regularized offline RL methods is typically slightly worse than that of other approaches, and here we show that this is largely because the policy regularization methods perform poorly due to their limited ability to accurately represent the behavior policy. This results in the regularization adversely affecting the policy improvement. For example, the policy regularization may limit the exploration space of the agent to a small region with only suboptimal actions and then the Q-learning will be induced to converge towards a suboptimal policy.The inaccurate policy regularization occurs for two main reasons: 1) policy classes are not expressive enough; 2) the regularization methods are improper. In most prior work, the policy is a Gaussian distribution with mean and diagonal covariance specified by the output of a neural network. However, as offline datasets are often collected by a mixture of policies, the true behavior policy may exhibit strong multi-modalities, skewness, or dependencies between different action dimensions, which cannot be well modeled by diagonal Gaussian policies(Shafiullah et al., 2022). In a particularly extreme, but not uncommon example, a Gaussian policy is used to fit bimodal training data by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from the data distribution to the policy distribution. This will result in the policy exhibiting mode-covering behavior and placing high density in the middle area of the two modes, which is actually the low-density region of the training data. In such cases, regularizing a new policy towards the behavior-cloned policy is likely to make the policy learning substantially worse. Second, the regularization, such as the KL divergence and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) (Kumar et al., 2019), is often not well suited for offline RL. The KL divergence needs access to explicit density values and MMD needs multiple action samples at each state for optimization. These methods require an extra step by first learning a behavior cloned policy to provide density values for KL optimization or random action samples for MMD optimization. Regularizing the current policy towards the behavior cloned policy can further induce approximation errors, since the cloned behavior policy may not model the true behavior policy well, due to limitations in the expressiveness of the policy class. We conduct a simple bandit experiment in Section 4, which illustrates these issues can occur even on a simple bandit task.",,,
251710245,GreenKGC: A Lightweight Knowledge Graph Completion Method,"Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to discover missing relationships between entities in knowledge graphs (KGs). Most prior KGC work focuses on learning embeddings for entities and relations through a simple scoring function. Yet, a higher-dimensional embedding space is usually required for a better reasoning capability, which leads to a larger model size and hinders applicability to real-world problems (e.g., large-scale KGs or mobile/edge computing). A lightweight modularized KGC solution, called GreenKGC, is proposed in this work to address this issue. GreenKGC consists of three modules: representation learning, feature pruning, and decision learning, to extract discriminant KG features and make accurate predictions on missing relationships using classifiers and negative sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that, in low dimensions, GreenKGC can outperform SOTA methods in most datasets. In addition, low-dimensional GreenKGC can achieve competitive or even better performance against high-dimensional models with a much smaller model size. We make our code publicly available. 1",,,

Given two snapshots C 1 and C 2 of a corpus taken respectively at two distinct timestamps T 1 and T 2 , we first propose an unsupervised method to select (a) pivot terms related to both C 1 and C 2 , and (b) anchor terms that are associated with a specific pivot term in each individual snapshot. We then generate prompts by filling manually compiled templates using the extracted pivot and anchor terms. Moreover, we propose an automatic method to learn time-sensitive templates from C 1 and C 2 , without requiring any human supervision. Next, we use the generated prompts to adapt a pretrained MLM to T 2 by fine-tuning using those prompts. Multiple experiments show that our proposed method reduces the perplexity of test sentences in C 2 , outperforming the current state-of-the-art.",,,
251903643,StoryTrans: Non-Parallel Story Author-Style Transfer with Discourse Representations and Content Enhancing,"Non-parallel text style transfer is an important task in natural language generation. However, previous studies concentrate on the token or sentence level, such as sentence sentiment and formality transfer, but neglect long style transfer at the discourse level. Long texts usually involve more complicated author linguistic preferences such as discourse structures than sentences. In this paper, we formulate the task of non-parallel story author-style transfer, which requires transferring an input story into a specified author style while maintaining source semantics. To tackle this problem, we propose a generation model, named StoryTrans, which leverages discourse representations to capture source content information and transfer them to target styles with learnable style embeddings. We use an additional training objective to disentangle stylistic features from the learned discourse representation to prevent the model from degenerating to an auto-encoder. Moreover, to enhance content preservation, we design a mask-and-fill framework to explicitly fuse style-specific keywords of source texts into generation. Furthermore, we constructed new datasets for this task in Chinese and English, respectively. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms strong baselines in overall performance of style transfer and content preservation. * Equal contribution. † Corresponding author 郭翰是古时候一名才子。一个夏日的晚上，他在院中乘凉。忽 然，一阵风起，送来一股沁人心脾的清香，一位少女驾着白云从 天而降，出现在郭翰眼前 … Guo Han was a talented man in ancient times.

251979354,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 TRANSFORMERS ARE SAMPLE-EFFICIENT WORLD MODELS,"Deep reinforcement learning agents are notoriously sample inefficient, which considerably limits their application to real-world problems. Recently, many model-based methods have been designed to address this issue, with learning in the imagination of a world model being one of the most prominent approaches. However, while virtually unlimited interaction with a simulated environment sounds appealing, the world model has to be accurate over extended periods of time. Motivated by the success of Transformers in sequence modeling tasks, we introduce IRIS, a data-efficient agent that learns in a world model composed of a discrete autoencoder and an autoregressive Transformer. With the equivalent of only two hours of gameplay in the Atari 100k benchmark, IRIS achieves a mean human normalized score of 1.046, and outperforms humans on 10 out of 26 games, setting a new state of the art for methods without lookahead search.

252089864,Faster federated optimization under second-order similarity,"Federated learning (FL) is a subfield of machine learning where multiple clients try to collaboratively learn a model over a network under communication constraints. We consider finite-sum federated optimization under a second-order function similarity condition and strong convexity, and propose two new algorithms: SVRP and Catalyzed SVRP. This second-order similarity condition has grown popular recently, and is satisfied in many applications including distributed statistical learning and differentially private empirical risk minimization. The first algorithm, SVRP, combines approximate stochastic proximal point evaluations, client sampling, and variance reduction. We show that SVRP is communication efficient and achieves superior performance to many existing algorithms when function similarity is high enough. Our second algorithm, Catalyzed SVRP, is a Catalyst-accelerated variant of SVRP that achieves even better performance and uniformly improves upon existing algorithms for federated optimization under second-order similarity and strong convexity. In the course of analyzing these algorithms, we provide a new analysis of the Stochastic Proximal Point Method (SPPM) that might be of independent interest. Our analysis of SPPM is simple, allows for approximate proximal point evaluations, does not require any smoothness assumptions, and shows a clear benefit in communication complexity over ordinary distributed stochastic gradient descent.arXiv:2209.02257v2 [cs.LG] 23 May 2023We answer the above question in the affirmative and show the utility of using client sampling in optimization under second-order similarity for strongly convex objectives. Our main contributions are as follows:• A new algorithm for federated optimization (SVRP, Algorithm 2). We develop a new algorithm, SVRP (Stochastic Variance-Reduced Proximal Point), that utilizes client sampling to improve upon the existing algorithms for solving Problem 1 under second-order similarity. SVRP has a better dependence on the number of clients M in its communication complexity than all existing algorithms (seeTable 1), and achieves superior performance when the dissimilarity constant δ is small enough. SVRP trades off a higher computational complexity for less communication.• Catalyst-accelerated SVRP. By using Catalyst (Lin et al., 2015), we accelerate SVRP and obtain a new algorithm (Catalyzed SVRP) that improves the dependence on the effective conditioning from δ 2 µ 2 to δ µ . Catalyzed SVRP also has a better convergence rate (in number of communication steps, ignoring constants and logarithmic factors) than all existing accelerated algorithms for this problem under Assumption 1, reducing the dependence on the number of clients multiplied by the effective conditioning δ µ from δ µ M to δ µ M 3/4 (seeTable 1).While both SVRP and Catalyzed SVRP achieve a communication complexity that is better than algorithms designed for the standard finite-sum setting (like SVRG or SAGA), the computational complexity is a lot worse. This is because we tradeoff local computation complexity for a reduced communication complexity. Additionally, both SVRP and Catalyzed SVRP are based upon a novel combination of variance-reduction techniques and the stochastic proximal point method (SPPM). SPPM is our starting point, and we provide a new analysis for it that might be of independent interest. Our analysis of SPPM is simple, allows for approximate evaluations of the proximal operator, and extends to include variance reduction. In Section 15 we also consider the more general constrained optimization problem and provide similar convergence rates in that setting.Related workDistributed optimization under Assumption 1. There is a long line of work analyzing distributed optimization under Assumption 1 and strong convexity: Shamir et al. (2014)  first gave DANE and analyzed it for quadratics, and showed the benefits of using second-order similarity in the setting of statistical learning for quadratic objectives. Zhang and Lin(2015)developed the DiSCO algorithm that improved upon DANE for quadratics, and also analyzed it for self-concordant objectives. Arjevani and Shamir(2015)gave a lower bound that matched the rate given by DANE, though without allowing for client sampling. The theory of DANE was later improved in (Yuan and Li, 2019), allowing for local convergence for non-quadratic objectives. Another algorithm SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et al., 2020b) can be seen as a variant of DANE and is also analyzed for quadratics. In the context of decentralized optimization, Sun et al. (2022) gave SONATA and showed a similar rate to DANE but for general strongly convex objectives, then Tian et al. (2022) improved the convergence rate of SONATA by acceleration. Finally, Kovalev et al. (2022) improved the convergence rate of accelerated SONATA even further by removing extra logarithmic factors.We give an overview of all related results inTable 1and provide more thorough comparisons in the theory and algorithms section.",,,
252199533,Detecting Suicide Risk in Online Counseling Services: A Study in a Low-Resource Language,"With the increased awareness of situations of mental crisis and their societal impact, online services providing emergency support are becoming commonplace in many countries. Computational models, trained on discussions between help-seekers and providers, can support suicide prevention by identifying at-risk individuals. However, the lack of domain-specific models, especially in low-resource languages, poses a significant challenge for the automatic detection of suicide risk. We propose a model that combines pre-trained language models (PLM) with a fixed set of manually crafted (and clinically approved) set of suicidal cues, followed by a two-stage fine-tuning process. Our model achieves 0.91 ROC-AUC and an F2-score of 0.55, significantly outperforming an array of strong baselines even early on in the conversation, which is critical for real-time detection in the field. Moreover, the model performs well across genders and age groups.",,,

In light of the well-learned visual features, there are works that transfer image representation to the video domain and achieve good results. However, adapting image-text pre-trained models to video-text pre-training (i.e., post-pretraining) has not demonstrated a significant advantage yet. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by raising and addressing two questions: 1) what are the factors hindering post-pretraining CLIP from improving performance on video-text tasks, and 2) how to mitigate the impact of these factors. Through a series of comparative experiments and analyses, we find that the data scale and domain gap between language sources have large impacts. By these observations, we propose an Omnisource Cross-modal Learning method equipped with a Video Proxy mechanism on the basis of CLIP, namely CLIP-ViP. Extensive results show that our approach improves the performance of CLIP on video-text retrieval by a large margin. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of datasets, including MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and Ac-tivityNet.

252408513,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 GENERATE RATHER THAN RETRIEVE: LARGE LANGU- AGE MODELS ARE STRONG CONTEXT GENERATORS,"Knowledge-intensive tasks, such as open-domain question answering (QA), require access to a large amount of world or domain knowledge. A common approach for knowledge-intensive tasks is to employ a retrieve-then-read pipeline that first retrieves a handful of relevant contextual documents from an external corpus such as Wikipedia and then predicts an answer conditioned on the retrieved documents. In this paper, we present a novel perspective for solving knowledge-intensive tasks by replacing document retrievers with large language model generators. We call our method generate-then-read (GENREAD), which first prompts a large language model to generate contextual documents based on a given question, and then reads the generated documents to produce the final answer. Furthermore, we propose a novel clustering-based prompting method that selects distinct prompts, in order to generate diverse documents that cover different perspectives, leading to better recall over acceptable answers. We conduct extensive experiments on three different knowledge-intensive tasks, including open-domain QA, fact checking, and dialogue system. Notably, GENREAD achieves 71.6 and 54.4 exact match scores on TriviaQA and WebQ, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieve-thenread pipeline DPR-FiD by +4.0 and +3.9, without retrieving any documents from any external knowledge source. Lastly, we demonstrate the model performance can be further improved by combining retrieval and generation.

252519173,PROMPTAGATOR : FEW-SHOT DENSE RETRIEVAL FROM 8 EXAMPLES,"Much recent research on information retrieval has focused on how to transfer from one task (typically with abundant supervised data) to various other tasks where supervision is limited, with the implicit assumption that it is possible to generalize from one task to all the rest. However, this overlooks the fact that there are many diverse and unique retrieval tasks, each targeting different search intents, queries, and search domains. In this paper, we suggest to work on Few-shot Dense Retrieval, a setting where each task comes with a short description and a few examples. To amplify the power of a few examples, we propose Promptbase Query Generation for Retriever (PROMPTAGATOR ), which leverages large language models (LLM) as a few-shot query generator, and creates task-specific retrievers based on the generated data. Powered by LLM's generalization ability, PROMPTAGATOR makes it possible to create task-specific end-to-end retrievers solely based on a few examples without using Natural Questions(Kwiatkowski et al., 2019)or MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016)  to train dual encoders. Surprisingly, LLM prompting with no more than 8 examples allows dual encoders to outperform heavily engineered models trained on MS MARCO like ColBERT v2(Santhanam et al., 2022)by more than 1.2 nDCG on average on 11 retrieval sets. Further training standard-size re-rankers using the same generated data yields another 5.0 point nDCG improvement. Our studies determine that query generation can be far more effective than previously observed, especially when a small amount of task-specific knowledge is given.",,,
252519395,Achieve the Minimum Width of Neural Net- works for Universal Approximation,"The universal approximation property (UAP) of neural networks is fundamental for deep learning, and it is well known that wide neural networks are universal approximators of continuous functions within both the L p norm and the continuous/uniform norm. However, the exact minimum width, w min , for the UAP has not been studied thoroughly. Recently, using a decoder-memorizer-encoder scheme, Park et al.(2021)found that w min = max(d x + 1, d y ) for both the L p -UAP of ReLU networks and the C-UAP of ReLU+STEP networks, where d x , d y are the input and output dimensions, respectively. In this paper, we consider neural networks with an arbitrary set of activation functions. We prove that both C-UAP and L p -UAP for functions on compact domains share a universal lower bound of the minimal width; that is, w * min = max(d x , d y ). In particular, the critical width, w * min , for L p -UAP can be achieved by leaky-ReLU networks, provided that the input or output dimension is larger than one. Our construction is based on the approximation power of neural ordinary differential equations and the ability to approximate flow maps by neural networks. The nonmonotone or discontinuous activation functions case and the one-dimensional case are also discussed.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 2, d y + 1). A summary of known upper/lower bounds on minimum width for the UAP can be found in Park et al. (2021).",,,
252519660,MetaPrompting: Learning to Learn Better Prompts,"Prompting method is regarded as one of the crucial progress for few-shot nature language processing. Recent research on prompting moves from discrete tokens based ""hard prompts"" to continuous ""soft prompts"", which employ learnable vectors as pseudo prompt tokens and achieve better performance. Though showing promising prospects, these softprompting methods are observed to rely heavily on good initialization to take effect. Unfortunately, obtaining a perfect initialization for soft prompts requires understanding of inner language models working and elaborate design, which is no easy task and has to restart from scratch for each new task. To remedy this, we propose a generalized soft prompting method called MetaPrompting, which adopts the well-recognized modelagnostic meta-learning algorithm to automatically find better prompt initialization that facilitates fast adaptation to new prompting tasks. Extensive experiments show MetaPrompting tackles soft prompt initialization problem and brings significant improvement on four different datasets (over 7 points improvement in accuracy for 1-shot setting), achieving new stateof-the-art performance.",,,
252544861,HIERARCHICAL SLICED WASSERSTEIN DISTANCE,"Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance has been widely used in different application scenarios since it can be scaled to a large number of supports without suffering from the curse of dimensionality. The value of sliced Wasserstein distance is the average of transportation cost between one-dimensional representations (projections) of original measures that are obtained by Radon Transform (RT). Despite its efficiency in the number of supports, estimating the sliced Wasserstein requires a relatively large number of projections in high-dimensional settings. Therefore, for applications where the number of supports is relatively small compared with the dimension, e.g., several deep learning applications where the mini-batch approaches are utilized, the complexities from matrix multiplication of Radon Transform become the main computational bottleneck. To address this issue, we propose to derive projections by linearly and randomly combining a smaller number of projections which are named bottleneck projections. We explain the usage of these projections by introducing Hierarchical Radon Transform (HRT) which is constructed by applying Radon Transform variants recursively. We then formulate the approach into a new metric between measures, named Hierarchical Sliced Wasserstein (HSW) distance. By proving the injectivity of HRT, we derive the metricity of HSW. Moreover, we investigate the theoretical properties of HSW including its connection to SW variants and its computational and sample complexities. Finally, we compare the computational cost and generative quality of HSW with the conventional SW on the task of deep generative modeling using various benchmark datasets including CIFAR10, CelebA, and Tiny ImageNet 1 .arXiv:2209.13570v5 [stat.ML] 6 Feb 2023Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 applications (Le et al., 2021;Xu et al., 2021;Yang et al., 2020). Despite the increasing importance of Wasserstein distance in applications, prior works have alluded to the concerns surrounding the high computational complexity of that distance. When the probability measures have at most n supports, the computational complexity of Wasserstein distance scales with the order of O(n 3 log n) (Pele & Werman, 2009). Additionally, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality, i.e., its sample complexity (the bounding gap of the distance between a probability measure and the empirical measures from its random samples) is of the order of O(n −1/d ) (Fournier & Guillin, 2015), where n is the sample size and d is the number of dimensions.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 randomly from the uniform distribution over the corresponding unit-hypersphere.

252595735,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 SPOTLIGHT: MOBILE UI UNDERSTANDING USING VISION-LANGUAGE MODELS WITH A FOCUS,"Mobile UI understanding is important for enabling various interaction tasks such as UI automation and accessibility. Previous mobile UI modeling often depends on the view hierarchy information of a screen, which directly provides the structural data of the UI, with the hope to bypass challenging tasks of visual modeling from screen pixels. However, view hierarchies are not always available, and are often corrupted with missing object descriptions or misaligned structure information. As a result, despite the use of view hierarchies could offer short-term gains, it may ultimately hinder the applicability and performance of the model. In this paper, we propose Spotlight, a vision-only approach for mobile UI understanding. Specifically, we enhance a vision-language model that only takes the screenshot of the UI and a region of interest on the screen-the focus-as the input. This general architecture of Spotlight is easily scalable and capable of performing a range of UI modeling tasks. Our experiments show that our model establishes SoTA results on several representative UI tasks and outperforms previous methods that use both screenshots and view hierarchies as inputs. Furthermore, we explore multi-task learning and few-shot prompting capacities of the proposed models, demonstrating promising results in the multi-task learning direction.",,,
252596087,RE-IMAGEN: RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED TEXT-TO-IMAGE GENERATOR,"Research on text-to-image generation has witnessed significant progress in generating diverse and photo-realistic images, driven by diffusion and auto-regressive models trained on large-scale image-text data. Though state-of-the-art models can generate high-quality images of common entities, they often have difficulty generating images of uncommon entities, such as 'Chortai (dog)' or 'Picarones (food)'. To tackle this issue, we present the Retrieval-Augmented Text-to-Image Generator (Re-Imagen), a generative model that uses retrieved information to produce high-fidelity and faithful images, even for rare or unseen entities. Given a text prompt, Re-Imagen accesses an external multi-modal knowledge base to retrieve relevant (image, text) pairs and uses them as references to generate the image. With this retrieval step, Re-Imagen is augmented with the knowledge of highlevel semantics and low-level visual details of the mentioned entities, and thus improves its accuracy in generating the entities' visual appearances. We train Re-Imagen on a constructed dataset containing (image, text, retrieval) triples to teach the model to ground on both text prompt and retrieval. Furthermore, we develop a new sampling strategy to interleave the classifier-free guidance for text and retrieval conditions to balance the text and retrieval alignment. Re-Imagen achieves significant gain on FID score over COCO and WikiImage. To further evaluate the capabilities of the model, we introduce EntityDrawBench, a new benchmark that evaluates image generation for diverse entities, from frequent to rare, across multiple object categories including dogs, foods, landmarks, birds, and characters. Human evaluation on EntityDrawBench shows that Re-Imagen can significantly improve the fidelity of generated images, especially on less frequent entities.",,,
252596252,DIFFUSION POSTERIOR SAMPLING FOR GENERAL NOISY INVERSE PROBLEMS,"Diffusion models have been recently studied as powerful generative inverse problem solvers, owing to their high quality reconstructions and the ease of combining existing iterative solvers. However, most works focus on solving simple linear inverse problems in noiseless settings, which significantly under-represents the complexity of real-world problems. In this work, we extend diffusion solvers to efficiently handle general noisy (non)linear inverse problems via approximation of the posterior sampling. Interestingly, the resulting posterior sampling scheme is a blended version of diffusion sampling with the manifold constrained gradient without a strict measurement consistency projection step, yielding a more desirable generative path in noisy settings compared to the previous studies. Our method demonstrates that diffusion models can incorporate various measurement noise statistics such as Gaussian and Poisson, and also efficiently handle noisy nonlinear inverse problems such as Fourier phase retrieval and non-uniform deblurring.",,,
252596292,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 BRIDGING THE GAP TO REAL-WORLD OBJECT- CENTRIC LEARNING,"Humans naturally decompose their environment into entities at the appropriate level of abstraction to act in the world. Allowing machine learning algorithms to derive this decomposition in an unsupervised way has become an important line of research. However, current methods are restricted to simulated data or require additional information in the form of motion or depth in order to successfully discover objects. In this work, we overcome this limitation by showing that reconstructing features from models trained in a self-supervised manner is a sufficient training signal for object-centric representations to arise in a fully unsupervised way. Our approach, DINOSAUR, significantly out-performs existing image-based object-centric learning models on simulated data and is the first unsupervised object-centric model that scales to real-world datasets such as COCO and PASCAL VOC. DINOSAUR is conceptually simple and shows competitive performance compared to more involved pipelines from the computer vision literature.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 image datasets, which do not include depth annotations or motion cues. Following deep learning's mantra of scale, another appealing approach could be to increase the capacity of the Slot Attention architecture. However, our experiments (Sec. 4.3) suggest that scale alone is not sufficient to close the gap between synthetic and real-world datasets. We thus conjecture that the image reconstruction objective on its own does not provide sufficient inductive bias to give rise to object groupings when objects have complex appearance. But instead of relying on auxiliary external signals, we introduce an additional inductive bias by reconstructing features that have a high level of homogeneity within objects. Such features can easily be obtained via recent self-supervised learning techniques like DINO (Caron et al., 2021). We show that combining such a feature reconstruction loss with existing grouping modules such as Slot Attention leads to models that significantly out-perform other image-based object-centric methods and bridge the gap to real-world object-centric representation learning. The proposed architecture DINOSAUR (DINO and Slot Attention Using Real-world data) is conceptually simple and highly competitive with existing unsupervised segmentation and object discovery methods in computer vision.",,,
252668796,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 AN EFFICIENT ENCODER-DECODER ARCHITECTURE WITH TOP-DOWN ATTENTION FOR SPEECH SEPARA- TION,"Deep neural networks have shown excellent prospects in speech separation tasks. However, obtaining good results while keeping a low model complexity remains challenging in real-world applications. In this paper, we provide a bio-inspired efficient encoder-decoder architecture by mimicking the brain's top-down attention, called TDANet, with decreased model complexity without sacrificing performance. The top-down attention in TDANet is extracted by the global attention (GA) module and the cascaded local attention (LA) layers. The GA module takes multi-scale acoustic features as input to extract global attention signal, which then modulates features of different scales by direct top-down connections. The LA layers use features of adjacent layers as input to extract the local attention signal, which is used to modulate the lateral input in a top-down manner. On three benchmark datasets, TDANet consistently achieved competitive separation performance to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with higher efficiency. Specifically, TDANet's multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) are only 5% of Sepformer, one of the previous SOTA models, and CPU inference time is only 10% of Sepformer. In addition, a large-size version of TDANet obtained SOTA results on three datasets, with MACs still only 10% of Sepformer and the CPU inference time only 24% of Sepformer. Our study suggests that top-down attention can be a more efficient strategy for speech separation.",,,
252683543,A NON-MONOTONIC SELF-TERMINATING LANGUAGE MODEL,"Recent large-scale neural autoregressive sequence models have shown impressive performances on a variety of natural language generation tasks. However, their generated sequences often exhibit degenerate properties such as non-termination, undesirable repetition, and premature termination, when generated with decoding algorithms such as greedy search, beam search, top-k sampling, and nucleus sampling. In this paper, we focus on the problem of non-terminating sequences resulting from an incomplete decoding algorithm. We first define an incomplete probable decoding algorithm which includes greedy search, top-k sampling, and nucleus sampling, beyond the incomplete decoding algorithm originally put forward by Welleck et al. (2020). We then propose a non-monotonic self-terminating language model, which significantly relaxes the constraint of monotonically increasing termination probability in the originally proposed self-terminating language model by Welleck et al. (2020), to address the issue of non-terminating sequences when using incomplete probable decoding algorithms. We prove that our proposed model prevents non-terminating sequences when using not only incomplete probable decoding algorithms but also beam search. We empirically validate our model on sequence completion tasks with various architectures. † New York University ‡ Prescient Design, Genentech § CIFAR Fellow Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 example, suppose there are two sequences in our dataset: ""I am a boy"" vs. ""I am a boy, and you are a girl."". Our language model trained on this dataset may or may not terminate after the former. Once our model decides not to end, it should dramatically reduce the termination probability to continue. The ST language model, which monotonically increase the termination probability, cannot capture such a case, where one sequence is a prefix of another. We thus propose a non-monotonic self-terminating (NMST) language model which guarantees the consistency with respect to greedy search, beam search, top-k sampling, and nucleus sampling without monotonically increasing termination probability.",,,
252683719,CAUSAL ESTIMATION FOR TEXT DATA WITH (APPAR-ENT) OVERLAP VIOLATIONS,"Consider the problem of estimating the causal effect of some attribute of a text document; for example: what effect does writing a polite vs. rude email have on response time?To estimate a causal effect from observational data, we need to adjust for confounding aspects of the text that affect both the treatment and outcome-e.g., the topic or writing level of the text.These confounding aspects are unknown a priori, so it seems natural to adjust for the entirety of the text (e.g., using a transformer).However, causal identification and estimation procedures rely on the assumption of overlap: for all levels of the adjustment variables, there is randomness leftover so that every unit could have (not) received treatment.Since the treatment here is itself an attribute of the text, it is perfectly determined, and overlap is apparently violated.The purpose of this paper is to show how to handle causal identification and obtain robust causal estimation in the presence of apparent overlap violations.In brief, the idea is to use supervised representation learning to produce a data representation that preserves confounding information while eliminating information that is only predictive of the treatment.This representation then suffices for adjustment and satisfies overlap.Adapting results on non-parametric estimation, we find that this procedure is robust to conditional outcome misestimation, yielding a low-absolute-bias estimator with valid uncertainty quantification under weak conditions.Empirical results show strong improvements in bias and uncertainty quantification relative to the natural baseline.Code, demo data and a tutorial are available at https://github.com/gl-ybnbxb/TI-estimator.",,,
252693109,MEDFAIR: BENCHMARKING FAIRNESS FOR MEDICAL IMAGING,"A multitude of work has shown that machine learning-based medical diagnosis systems can be biased against certain subgroups of people. This has motivated a growing number of bias mitigation algorithms that aim to address fairness issues in machine learning. However, it is difficult to compare their effectiveness in medical imaging for two reasons. First, there is little consensus on the criteria to assess fairness. Second, existing bias mitigation algorithms are developed under different settings, e.g., datasets, model selection strategies, backbones, and fairness metrics, making a direct comparison and evaluation based on existing results impossible. In this work, we introduce MEDFAIR, a framework to benchmark the fairness of machine learning models for medical imaging. MEDFAIR covers eleven algorithms from various categories, ten datasets from different imaging modalities, and three model selection criteria. Through extensive experiments, we find that the under-studied issue of model selection criterion can have a significant impact on fairness outcomes; while in contrast, state-of-the-art bias mitigation algorithms do not significantly improve fairness outcomes over empirical risk minimization (ERM) in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. We evaluate fairness from various perspectives and make recommendations for different medical application scenarios that require different ethical principles. Our framework provides a reproducible and easy-to-use entry point for the development and evaluation of future bias mitigation algorithms in deep learning.

However, a straightforward comparison of algorithmic fairness for medical imaging is difficult, as there is no consensus on a single metric for fairness of medical imaging models. Group fairness (Dwork et al., 2012; Verma & Rubin, 2018)  is a popular and intuitive definition adopted by many debiasing algorithms, which optimises for equal performance among subgroups. However, this can lead to a trade-off of increasing fairness by decreasing the performance of the advantaged group, reducing overall utility substantially. Doing so may violate the ethical principles of beneficence and non-maleficence (Beauchamp, 2003), especially for some medical applications where all subgroups need to be protected. There are also other fairness definitions, including individual fairness (Dwork et al., 2012), minimax fairness (Diana et al., 2021), counterfactual fairness (Kusner et al., 2017), etc. It is thus important to consider which definition should be used for evaluations.In addition to the use of differing evaluation metrics, different experimental designs used by existing studies prevent direct comparisons between algorithms based on the existing literature. Most obviously, each study tends to use different datasets to evaluate their debiasing algorithms, preventing direct comparisons of results. Furthermore, many bias mitigation studies focus on evaluating tabular data with low-capacity models (Madras et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2019; Diana et al., 2021), and recent analysis has shown that their conclusions do not generalise to high-capacity deep networks used for the analysis of image data (Zietlow et al., 2022). A crucial but less obvious issue is the choice of model selection strategy for hyperparameter search and early stopping. Individual bias mitigation studies are divergent or vague in their model selection criteria, leading to inconsistent comparisons even if the same datasets are used. Finally, given the effort required to collect and annotate medical imaging data, models are usually deployed in a different domain than the domain used for data collection. (E.g., data collected at hospital A is used to train a model deployed at hospital B). While the maintenance of prediction quality across datasets has been well studied, it is unclear if fairness achieved within one dataset (in-distribution) holds under dataset shift (out-of-distribution).In order to address these challenges, we provide the first comprehensive fairness benchmark for medical imaging -MEDFAIR. We conduct extensive experiments across eleven algorithms, ten datasets, four sensitive attributes, and three model selection strategies to assess bias mitigation algorithms in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. We report multiple evaluation metrics and conduct rigorous statistical tests to find whether any of the algorithms is significantly better. Having trained over 7,000 models using 6,800 GPU-hours, we have the following observations:• Bias widely exists in ERM models trained in different modalities, which is reflected in the predictive performance gap between different subgroups for multiple metrics. fairness 360: An extensible toolkit for detecting and mitigating algorithmic bias.",,,

Inherent challenges in such settings are (1) a trade-off between reward optimization and adhering to safety constraints, (2) partial observability, and (3) high-dimensional observations. We formalize the problem in a constrained, partially observable Markov decision process framework, where an agent obtains distinct reward and safety signals. To address the curse of dimensionality, we employ a novel safety critic using the stochastic latent actor-critic (SLAC) approach. The latent variable model predicts rewards and safety violations, and we use the safety critic to train safe policies. Using well-known benchmark environments, we demonstrate competitive performance over existing approaches with respects to computational requirements, final reward return, and satisfying the safety constraints.",,,
252715693,TIME WILL TELL: NEW OUTLOOKS AND A BASELINE FOR TEMPORAL MULTI-VIEW 3D OBJECT DETECTION,"While recent camera-only 3D detection methods leverage multiple timesteps, the limited history they use significantly hampers the extent to which temporal fusion can improve object perception. Observing that existing works' fusion of multiframe images are instances of temporal stereo matching, we find that performance is hindered by the interplay between 1) the low granularity of matching resolution and 2) the sub-optimal multi-view setup produced by limited history usage. Our theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrates that the optimal temporal difference between views varies significantly for different pixels and depths, making it necessary to fuse many timesteps over long-term history. Building on our investigation, we propose to generate a cost volume from a long history of image observations, compensating for the coarse but efficient matching resolution with a more optimal multi-view matching setup. Further, we augment the per-frame monocular depth predictions used for long-term, coarse matching with short-term, fine-grained matching and find that long and short term temporal fusion are highly complementary. While maintaining high efficiency, our framework sets new stateof-the-art on nuScenes, achieving first place on the test set and outperforming previous best art by 5.2% mAP and 3.7% NDS on the validation set.

252735252,ACCELERATED SINGLE-CALL METHODS FOR CON- STRAINED MIN-MAX OPTIMIZATION,"We study first-order methods for constrained min-max optimization. Existing methods either require two gradient calls or two projections in each iteration, which may be costly in some applications. In this paper, we first show that a variant of the Optimistic Gradient (OG) method, a singlecall single-projection algorithm, has O( 1 √ T ) best-iterate convergence rate for inclusion problems with operators that satisfy the weak Minty variation inequality (MVI). Our second result is the first single-call singleprojection algorithm -the Accelerated Reflected Gradient (ARG) method that achieves the optimal O( 1 T ) last-iterate convergence rate for inclusion problems that satisfy negative comonotonicity. Both the weak MVI and negative comonotonicity are well-studied assumptions and capture a rich set of non-convex non-concave min-max optimization problems. Finally, we show that the Reflected Gradient (RG) method, another single-call single-projection algorithm, has O( 1 √ T ) last-iterate convergence rate for constrained convex-concave min-max optimization, answering an open problem of (Hsieh et al., 2019). Our convergence rates hold for standard measures such as the tangent residual and the natural residual.",,,
252735281,Unmasking the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: What's Encoded in a Winning Ticket's Mask?,"Modern deep learning involves training costly, highly overparameterized networks, thus motivating the search for sparser networks that require less compute and memory but can still be trained to the same accuracy as the full network (i.e. matching). Iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) is a state of the art algorithm that can find such highly sparse matching subnetworks, known as winning tickets. IMP operates by iterative cycles of training, masking a fraction of smallest magnitude weights, rewinding unmasked weights back to an early training point, and repeating. Despite its simplicity, the underlying principles for when and how IMP finds winning tickets remain elusive. In particular, what useful information does an IMP mask found at the end of training convey to a rewound network near the beginning of training? How does SGD allow the network to extract this information? And why is iterative pruning needed, i.e. why can't we prune to very high sparsities in one shot? We develop answers to these questions in terms of the geometry of the error landscape. First, we find that-at higher sparsities-pairs of pruned networks at successive pruning iterations are connected by a linear path with zero error barrier if and only if they are matching. This indicates that masks found at the end of training convey to the rewind point the identity of an axial subspace that intersects a desired linearly connected mode of a matching sublevel set. Second, we show SGD can exploit this information due to a strong form of robustness: it can return to this mode despite strong perturbations early in training. Third, we show how the flatness of the error landscape at the end of training determines a limit on the fraction of weights that can be pruned at each iteration of IMP. This analysis yields a new quantitative link between IMP performance and the Hessian eigenspectrum. Finally, we show that the role of retraining in IMP is to find a network with new small weights to prune. Overall, these results make progress toward demystifying the existence of winning tickets by revealing the fundamental role of error landscape geometry in the algorithms used to find them.",,,
252762275,AUTOMATIC CHAIN OF THOUGHT PROMPTING IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS,"Large language models (LLMs) can perform complex reasoning by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Providing these steps for prompting demonstrations is called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. CoT prompting has two major paradigms. One leverages a simple prompt like ""Let's think step by step"" to facilitate step-by-step thinking before answering a question. The other uses a few manual demonstrations one by one, each composed of a question and a reasoning chain that leads to an answer. The superior performance of the second paradigm hinges on the hand-crafting of task-specific demonstrations one by one. We show that such manual efforts may be eliminated by leveraging LLMs with the ""Let's think step by step"" prompt to generate reasoning chains for demonstrations one by one, i.e., let's think not just step by step, but also one by one. However, these generated chains often come with mistakes. To mitigate the effect of such mistakes, we find that diversity matters for automatically constructing demonstrations. We propose an automatic CoT prompting method: Auto-CoT. It samples questions with diversity and generates reasoning chains to construct demonstrations. On ten public benchmark reasoning tasks with GPT-3, Auto-CoT consistently matches or exceeds the performance of the CoT paradigm that requires manual designs of demonstrations.",,,
252762429,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 NEUROEVOLUTION IS A COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVE TO REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR SKILL DISCOVERY,"Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training neural policies to solve complex control tasks. However, these policies tend to be overfit to the exact specifications of the task and environment they were trained on, and thus do not perform well when conditions deviate slightly or when composed hierarchically to solve even more complex tasks. Recent work has shown that training a mixture of policies, as opposed to a single one, that are driven to explore different regions of the state-action space can address this shortcoming by generating a diverse set of behaviors, referred to as skills, that can be collectively used to great effect in adaptation tasks or for hierarchical planning. This is typically realized by including a diversity term -often derived from information theory -in the objective function optimized by RL. However these approaches often require careful hyperparameter tuning to be effective. In this work, we demonstrate that less widely-used neuroevolution methods, specifically Quality Diversity (QD), are a competitive alternative to information-theory-augmented RL for skill discovery. Through an extensive empirical evaluation comparing eight state-of-the-art algorithms (four flagship algorithms from each line of work) on the basis of (i) metrics directly evaluating the skills' diversity, (ii) the skills' performance on adaptation tasks, and (iii) the skills' performance when used as primitives for hierarchical planning; QD methods are found to provide equal, and sometimes improved, performance whilst being less sensitive to hyperparameters and more scalable. As no single method is found to provide near-optimal performance across all environments, there is a rich scope for further research which we support by proposing future directions and providing optimized open-source implementations. res.

252780545,Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 LEARNING TO DECOMPOSE VISUAL FEATURES WITH LATENT TEXTUAL PROMPTS,"Recent advances in pre-training vision-language models like CLIP(Radford et al., 2021)have shown great potential in learning transferable visual representations. Nonetheless, for downstream inference, CLIP-like models suffer from either 1) degraded accuracy and robustness in the case of inaccurate text descriptions during retrieval-based inference (the challenge for zero-shot protocol); or 2) breaking the well-established vision-language alignment (the challenge for linear probing). To address them, we propose Decomposed Feature Prompting (DeFo). DeFo leverages a flexible number of learnable embeddings as textual input while maintaining the vision-language dual-model architecture, which enables the model to learn decomposed visual features with the help of feature-level textual prompts. We further use an additional linear layer to perform classification, allowing a scalable size of language inputs. Our empirical study shows DeFo's significance in improving the vision-language models. For example, DeFo obtains 73.2% test accuracy on ImageNet with a ResNet-50 backbone without tuning any pretrained weights of both the vision and language encoder, outperforming zero-shot CLIP by a large margin of 15.0%, and outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language prompt tuning method by 7.6%.",,,
252780822,Distilling Causal Effect from Miscellaneous Other-Class for Continual Named Entity Recognition,"Continual Learning for Named Entity Recognition (CL-NER) aims to learn a growing number of entity types over time from a stream of data. However, simply learning Other-Class in the same way as new entity types amplifies the catastrophic forgetting and leads to a substantial performance drop. The main cause behind this is that Other-Class samples usually contain old entity types, and the old knowledge in these Other-Class samples is not preserved properly. Thanks to the causal inference, we identify that the forgetting is caused by the missing causal effect from the old data. To this end, we propose a unified causal framework to retrieve the causality from both new entity types and Other-Class. Furthermore, we apply curriculum learning to mitigate the impact of label noise and introduce a self-adaptive weight for balancing the causal effects between new entity types and Other-Class. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-theart method by a large margin. Moreover, our method can be combined with the existing stateof-the-art methods to improve the performance in CL-NER. 1",,,
252815403,Contrastive Video-Language Learning with Fine-grained Frame Sampling,"Despite recent progress in video and language representation learning, the weak or sparse correspondence between the two modalities remains a bottleneck in the area. Most videolanguage models are trained via pair-level loss to predict whether a pair of video and text is aligned. However, even in paired video-text segments, only a subset of the frames are semantically relevant to the corresponding text, with the remainder representing noise; where the ratio of noisy frames is higher for longer videos. We propose FineCo (Fine-grained Contrastive Loss for Frame Sampling), an approach to better learn video and language representations with a fine-grained contrastive objective operating on video frames. It helps distil a video by selecting the frames that are semantically equivalent to the text, improving cross-modal correspondence. Building on the well established VideoCLIP model as a starting point, FineCo achieves state-of-the-art performance on YouCookII, a text-video retrieval benchmark with long videos. FineCo also achieves competitive results on text-video retrieval (MSR-VTT), and video question answering datasets (MSR-VTT QA and MSR-VTT MC) with shorter videos.",,,
252815807,UNDERSTANDING EMBODIED REFERENCE WITH TOUCH-LINE TRANSFORMER,"We study embodied reference understanding, the task of locating referents using embodied gestural signals and language references. Human studies have revealed that objects referred to or pointed to do not lie on the elbow-wrist line, a common misconception; instead, they lie on the so-called virtual touch line. However, existing human pose representations fail to incorporate the virtual touch line. To tackle this problem, we devise the touch-line transformer: It takes as input tokenized visual and textual features and simultaneously predicts the referent's bounding box and a touch-line vector. Leveraging this touch-line prior, we further devise a geometric consistency loss that encourages the co-linearity between referents and touch lines. Using the touch-line as gestural information improves model performances significantly. Experiments on the YouRefIt dataset show our method achieves a +25.0% accuracy improvement under the 0.75 IoU criterion, closing 63.6% of the gap between model and human performances. Furthermore, we computationally verify prior human studies by showing that computational models more accurately locate referents when using the virtual touch line than when using the elbow-wrist line.",,,
252816010,REV: Information-Theoretic Evaluation of Free-Text Rationales,"Generating free-text rationales is a promising step towards explainable NLP, yet evaluating such rationales remains a challenge. Existing metrics have mostly focused on measuring the association between the rationale and a given label. We argue that an ideal metric should focus on the new information uniquely provided in the rationale that is otherwise not provided in the input or the label. We investigate this research problem from an information-theoretic perspective using conditional V-information (Hewitt et al., 2021). More concretely, we propose a metric called REV (Rationale Evaluation with conditional V-information), to quantify the amount of new, label-relevant information in a rationale beyond the information already available in the input or the label. Experiments across four benchmarks with reasoning tasks, including chain-of-thought, demonstrate the effectiveness of REV in evaluating rationale-label pairs, compared to existing metrics. We further demonstrate REV is consistent with human judgments on rationale evaluations and provides more sensitive measurements of new information in free-text rationales. When used alongside traditional performance metrics, REV provides deeper insights into models' reasoning and prediction processes. . 2015.

With an urgent interest in the use of conversational agents for broader societal applications, there is a need to advance the stateof-the-art in argument parsers for dialogues. This enables progress towards more purposeful conversations involving persuasion, debate and deliberation. This paper discusses Dialo-AP, an end-to-end argument parser that constructs argument graphs from dialogues. We formulate AM as dependency parsing of elementary and argumentative discourse units; the system is trained using extensive pre-training and curriculum learning comprising nine diverse corpora. Dialo-AP is capable of generating argument graphs from dialogues by performing all subtasks of AM. Compared to existing state-ofthe-art baselines, Dialo-AP achieves significant improvements across all tasks, which is further validated through rigorous human evaluation.",,,
252819095,MuCDN: Mutual Conversational Detachment Network for Emotion Recognition in Multi-Party Conversations,"As an emerging research topic in natural language processing community, emotion recognition in multi-party conversations has attained increasing interest. Previous approaches that focus either on dyadic or multi-party scenarios exert much effort to cope with the challenge of emotional dynamics and achieve appealing results. However, since emotional interactions among speakers are often more complicated within the entangled multi-party conversations, these works are limited in capturing effective emotional clues in conversational context. In this work, we propose Mutual Conversational Detachment Network (MuCDN) to clearly understand the conversational context by separating conversations into detached threads. Specifically, two detachment ways are devised to perform context and speaker-specific modeling within detached threads and they are bridged through a mutual module. Experimental results on two datasets show that our model achieves better performance over the baseline models.",,,
252846202,GRADIENT-GUIDED IMPORTANCE SAMPLING FOR LEARNING BINARY ENERGY-BASED MODELS,"Learning energy-based models (EBMs) is known to be difficult especially on discrete data where gradient-based learning strategies cannot be applied directly. Although ratio matching is a sound method to learn discrete EBMs, it suffers from expensive computation and excessive memory requirements, thereby resulting in difficulties in learning EBMs on high-dimensional data. Motivated by these limitations, in this study, we propose ratio matching with gradient-guided importance sampling (RMwGGIS). Particularly, we use the gradient of the energy function w.r.t. the discrete data space to approximately construct the provably optimal proposal distribution, which is subsequently used by importance sampling to efficiently estimate the original ratio matching objective. We perform experiments on density modeling over synthetic discrete data, graph generation, and training Ising models to evaluate our proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly alleviate the limitations of ratio matching, perform more effectively in practice, and scale to high-dimensional problems.

Annotations include demarcations of spans corresponding to medical claims, personal experiences, and questions. We collect additional granular annotations on identified claims.

One of which is to track the agent's mental state transition and teach the agent to make decisions guided by its value like a human. Towards this end, we propose to incorporate mental state simulation and value modeling into dialogue agents. First, we build a hybrid mental state parser that extracts information from both the dialogue and event observations and maintains a graphical representation of the agent's mind; Meanwhile, the transformer-based value model learns human preferences from the human value dataset, VALUENET. Empirical results show that the proposed model attains state-of-the-art performance on the dialogue/action/emotion prediction task in the fantasy text-adventure game dataset, LIGHT. We also show example cases to demonstrate: (i) how the proposed mental state parser can assist the agent's decision by grounding on the context like locations and objects, and (ii) how the value model can help the agent make decisions based on its personal priorities.Alex Abella. 2009.

252873073,Rethinking Annotation: Can Language Learners Contribute?,"Researchers have traditionally recruited native speakers to provide annotations for widely used benchmark datasets. However, there are languages for which recruiting native speakers can be difficult, and it would help to find learners of those languages to annotate the data. In this paper, we investigate whether language learners can contribute annotations to benchmark datasets. In a carefully controlled annotation experiment, we recruit 36 language learners, provide two types of additional resources (dictionaries and machine-translated sentences), and perform mini-tests to measure their language proficiency. We target three languages, English, Korean, and Indonesian, and the four NLP tasks of sentiment analysis, natural language inference, named entity recognition, and machine reading comprehension. We find that language learners, especially those with intermediate or advanced levels of language proficiency, are able to provide fairly accurate labels with the help of additional resources. Moreover, we show that data annotation improves learners' language proficiency in terms of vocabulary and grammar. One implication of our findings is that broadening the annotation task to include language learners can open up the opportunity to build benchmark datasets for languages for which it is difficult to recruit native speakers.",,,
252873117,Towards a Unified Multi-Dimensional Evaluator for Text Generation,"Multi-dimensional evaluation is the dominant paradigm for human evaluation in Natural Language Generation (NLG), i.e., evaluating the generated text from multiple explainable dimensions, such as coherence and fluency. However, automatic evaluation in NLG is still dominated by similarity-based metrics, and we lack a reliable framework for a more comprehensive evaluation of advanced models. In this paper, we propose a unified multi-dimensional evaluator UNIEVAL for NLG. We re-frame NLG evaluation as a Boolean Question Answering (QA) task, and by guiding the model with different questions, we can use one evaluator to evaluate from multiple dimensions. Furthermore, thanks to the unified Boolean QA format, we are able to introduce an intermediate learning phase that enables UNIEVAL to incorporate external knowledge from multiple related tasks and gain further improvement. Experiments on three typical NLG tasks show that UNIEVAL correlates substantially better with human judgments than existing metrics. Specifically, compared to the top-performing unified evaluators, UNIEVAL achieves a 23% higher correlation on text summarization, and over 43% on dialogue response generation. Also, UNIEVAL demonstrates a strong zero-shot learning ability for unseen evaluation dimensions and tasks.

252907554,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 BAYES RISK CTC: CONTROLLABLE CTC ALIGNMENT IN SEQUENCE-TO-SEQUENCE TASKS,"Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq) tasks transcribe the input sequence to a target sequence. The Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) criterion is widely used in multiple seq2seq tasks. Besides predicting the target sequence, a side product of CTC is to predict the alignment, which is the most probable input-long sequence that specifies a hard aligning relationship between the input and target units. As there are multiple potential aligning sequences (called paths) that are equally considered in CTC formulation, the choice of which path will be most probable and become the predicted alignment is always uncertain. In addition, it is usually observed that the alignment predicted by vanilla CTC will drift compared with its reference and rarely provides practical functionalities. Thus, the motivation of this work is to make the CTC alignment prediction controllable and thus equip CTC with extra functionalities. The Bayes risk CTC (BRCTC) criterion is then proposed in this work, in which a customizable Bayes risk function is adopted to enforce the desired characteristics of the predicted alignment. With the risk function, the BRCTC is a general framework to adopt some customizable preference over the paths in order to concentrate the posterior into a particular subset of the paths. In applications, we explore one particular preference which yields models with the down-sampling ability and reduced inference costs. By using BRCTC with another preference for early emissions, we obtain an improved performance-latency trade-off for online models. Experimentally, the proposed BRCTC, along with a trimming approach, enables us to reduce the inference cost of offline models by up to 47% without performance degradation; BRCTC also cuts down the overall latency of online systems to an unseen level 1 .",,,
252907578,Automatic Creation of Named Entity Recognition Datasets by Querying Phrase Representations,"Most weakly supervised named entity recognition (NER) models rely on domain-specific dictionaries provided by experts. This approach is infeasible in many domains where dictionaries do not exist. While a phrase retrieval model was used to construct pseudo-dictionaries with entities retrieved from Wikipedia automatically in a recent study, these dictionaries often have limited coverage because the retriever is likely to retrieve popular entities rather than rare ones. In this study, we present a novel framework, HighGEN, that generates NER datasets with high-coverage pseudo-dictionaries. Specifically, we create entity-rich dictionaries with a novel search method, called phrase embedding search, which encourages the retriever to search a space densely populated with various entities. In addition, we use a new verification process based on the embedding distance between candidate entity mentions and entity types to reduce the false-positive noise in weak labels generated by high-coverage dictionaries. We demonstrate that HighGEN outperforms the previous best model by an average F1 score of 4.7 across five NER benchmark datasets.",,,
252918439,QuAnt: Quantum Annealing with Learnt Couplings,"Modern quantum annealers can find high-quality solutions to combinatorial optimisation objectives given as quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) problems. Unfortunately, obtaining suitable QUBO forms in computer vision remains challenging and currently requires problem-specific analytical derivations. Moreover, such explicit formulations impose tangible constraints on solution encodings. In stark contrast to prior work, this paper proposes to learn QUBO forms from data through gradient backpropagation instead of deriving them. As a result, the solution encodings can be chosen flexibly and compactly. Furthermore, our methodology is general and virtually independent of the specifics of the target problem type. We demonstrate the advantages of learnt QUBOs on the diverse problem types of graph matching, 2D point cloud alignment and 3D rotation estimation. Our results are competitive with the previous quantum state of the art while requiring much fewer logical and physical qubits, enabling our method to scale to larger problems.

252918792,PeerDA: Data Augmentation via Modeling Peer Relation for Span Identification Tasks *,"Span identification aims at identifying specific text spans from text input and classifying them into pre-defined categories. Different from previous works that merely leverage the Subordinate (SUB) relation (i.e. if a span is an instance of a certain category) to train models, this paper for the first time explores the Peer (PR) relation, which indicates that two spans are instances of the same category and share similar features. Specifically, a novel Peer Data Augmentation (PeerDA) approach is proposed which employs span pairs with the PR relation as the augmentation data for training. PeerDA has two unique advantages: (1) There are a large number of PR span pairs for augmenting the training data. (2) The augmented data can prevent the trained model from over-fitting the superficial span-category mapping by pushing the model to leverage the span semantics. Experimental results on ten datasets over four diverse tasks across seven domains demonstrate the effectiveness of PeerDA. Notably, PeerDA achieves state-of-the-art results on six of them.",,,
253080708,FOSR: FIRST-ORDER SPECTRAL REWIRING FOR ADDRESSING OVERSQUASHING IN GNNS,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are able to leverage the structure of graph data by passing messages along the edges of the graph. While this allows GNNs to learn features depending on the graph structure, for certain graph topologies it leads to inefficient information propagation and a problem known as oversquashing. This has recently been linked with the curvature and spectral gap of the graph. On the other hand, adding edges to the message-passing graph can lead to increasingly similar node representations and a problem known as oversmoothing. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm that prevents oversquashing by systematically adding edges to the graph based on spectral expansion. We combine this with a relational architecture, which lets the GNN preserve the original graph structure and provably prevents oversmoothing. We find experimentally that our algorithm outperforms existing graph rewiring methods in several graph classification tasks.",,,
253098395,Salience Allocation as Guidance for Abstractive Summarization,"Abstractive summarization models typically learn to capture the salient information from scratch implicitly. Recent literature adds extractive summaries as guidance for abstractive summarization models to provide hints of salient content and achieves better performance. However, extractive summaries as guidance could be over strict, leading to information loss or noisy signals. Furthermore, it cannot easily adapt to documents with various abstractiveness. As the number and allocation of salience content pieces vary, it is hard to find a fixed threshold deciding which content should be included in the guidance. In this paper, we propose a novel summarization approach with a flexible and reliable salience guidance, namely SEASON (SaliencE Allocation as Guidance for Abstractive SummarizatiON). SEASON utilizes the allocation of salience expectation to guide abstractive summarization and adapts well to articles in different abstractiveness.

253098758,"Syntactic Surprisal From Neural Models Predicts, But Underestimates, Human Processing Difficulty From Syntactic Ambiguities","Humans exhibit garden path effects: When reading sentences that are temporarily structurally ambiguous, they slow down when the structure is disambiguated in favor of the less preferred alternative. Surprisal theory(Hale, 2001;Levy, 2008), a prominent explanation of this finding, proposes that these slowdowns are due to the unpredictability of each of the words that occur in these sentences. Challenging this hypothesis, van Schijndel and Linzen (2021) find that estimates of the cost of word predictability derived from language models severely underestimate the magnitude of human garden path effects. In this work, we consider whether this underestimation is due to the fact that humans weight syntactic factors in their predictions more highly than language models do. We propose a method for estimating syntactic predictability from a language model, allowing us to weigh the cost of lexical and syntactic predictability independently. We find that treating syntactic predictability independently from lexical predictability indeed results in larger estimates of garden path. At the same time, even when syntactic predictability is independently weighted, surprisal still greatly underestimate the magnitude of human garden path effects. Our results support the hypothesis that predictability is not the only factor responsible for the processing cost associated with garden path sentences.",,,
253116552,Universal Evasion Attacks on Summarization Scoring,"The automatic scoring of summaries is important as it guides the development of summarizers. Scoring is also complex, as it involves multiple aspects such as fluency, grammar, and even textual entailment with the source text. However, summary scoring has not been considered a machine learning task to study its accuracy and robustness. In this study, we place automatic scoring in the context of regression machine learning tasks and perform evasion attacks to explore its robustness. Attack systems predict a non-summary string from each input, and these non-summary strings achieve competitive scores with good summarizers on the most popular metrics: ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore. Attack systems also ""outperform"" state-of-the-art summarization methods on ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L, and score the second-highest on METEOR. Furthermore, a BERTScore backdoor is observed: a simple trigger can score higher than any automatic summarization method. The evasion attacks in this work indicate the low robustness of current scoring systems at the system level. We hope that our highlighting of these proposed attacks will facilitate the development of summary scores.",,,

Prior works mainly focus on adopting advanced RL techniques to train the ToD agents, while the design of the reward function is not well studied. This paper aims at answering the question of how to efficiently learn and leverage a reward function for training end-to-end (E2E) ToD agents. Specifically, we introduce two generalized objectives for reward-function learning, inspired by the classical learning-to-rank literature. Further, we utilize the learned reward function to guide the training of the E2E ToD agent.

In this work, we present SSD-LM-a diffusion-based language model with two key design choices. First, SSD-LM is semi-autoregressive, iteratively generating blocks of text, allowing for flexible output length at decoding time while enabling local bidirectional context updates. Second, it is simplex-based, performing diffusion on the natural vocabulary space rather than a learned latent space, allowing us to incorporate classifier guidance and modular control using offthe-shelf classifiers without any adaptation. We evaluate SSD-LM on unconstrained text generation benchmarks, and show that it matches or outperforms strong autoregressive GPT-2 models across standard quality and diversity metrics, while vastly outperforming diffusionbased baselines. On controlled text generation, SSD-LM also outperforms competitive baselines, with an extra advantage in modularity. 1 J. Atchison and S.M. Shen. 1980.

253255190,CHARACTERIZING INTRINSIC COMPOSITIONALITY IN TRANSFORMERS WITH TREE PROJECTIONS,"When trained on language data, do transformers learn some arbitrary computation that utilizes the full capacity of the architecture or do they learn a simpler, treelike computation, hypothesized to underlie compositional meaning systems like human languages? There is an apparent tension between compositional accounts of human language understanding, which are based on a restricted bottom-up computational process, and the enormous success of neural models like transformers, which can route information arbitrarily between different parts of their input. One possibility is that these models, while extremely flexible in principle, in practice learn to interpret language hierarchically, ultimately building sentence representations close to those predictable by a bottom-up, tree-structured model. To evaluate this possibility, we describe an unsupervised and parameter-free method to functionally project the behavior of any transformer into the space of tree-structured networks. Given an input sentence, we produce a binary tree that approximates the transformer's representation-building process and a score that captures how ""treelike"" the transformer's behavior is on the input. While calculation of this score does not require training any additional models, it provably upper-bounds the fit between a transformer and any tree-structured approximation. Using this method, we show that transformers for three different tasks become more tree-like over the course of training, in some cases unsupervisedly recovering the same trees as supervised parsers. These trees, in turn, are predictive of model behavior, with more tree-like models generalizing better on tests of compositional generalization. arXiv:2211.01288v2 [cs.CL] 3 Nov 2022 Prepint.

We demonstrate that in-context learning performance can be highly unstable across samples of examples, indicating the idiosyncrasies of how language models acquire information. We formulate example selection for in-context learning as a sequential decision problem, and propose a reinforcement learning algorithm for identifying generalizable policies to select demonstration examples. For GPT-2, our learned policies demonstrate strong abilities of generalizing to unseen tasks in training, with a 5.8% improvement on average. Examples selected from our learned policies can even achieve a small improvement on GPT-3 Ada.

253510295,EDGE GUIDED GANS WITH CONTRASTIVE LEARNING FOR SEMANTIC IMAGE SYNTHESIS,"We propose a novel edge guided generative adversarial network with contrastive learning (ECGAN) for the challenging semantic image synthesis task. Although considerable improvement has been achieved, the quality of synthesized images is far from satisfactory due to three largely unresolved challenges. 1) The semantic labels do not provide detailed structural information, making it difficult to synthesize local details and structures. 2) The widely adopted CNN operations such as convolution, down-sampling, and normalization usually cause spatial resolution loss and thus cannot fully preserve the original semantic information, leading to semantically inconsistent results (e.g., missing small objects). 3) Existing semantic image synthesis methods focus on modeling ""local"" semantic information from a single input semantic layout. However, they ignore ""global"" semantic information of multiple input semantic layouts, i.e., semantic cross-relations between pixels across different input layouts. To tackle 1), we propose to use edge as an intermediate representation which is further adopted to guide image generation via a proposed attention guided edge transfer module. Edge information is produced by a convolutional generator and introduces detailed structure information. To tackle 2), we design an effective module to selectively highlight class-dependent feature maps according to the original semantic layout to preserve the semantic information. To tackle 3), inspired by current methods in contrastive learning, we propose a novel contrastive learning method, which aims to enforce pixel embeddings belonging to the same semantic class to generate more similar image content than those from different classes. Doing so can capture more semantic relations by explicitly exploring the structures of labeled pixels from multiple input semantic layouts. Experiments on three challenging datasets show that our ECGAN achieves significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods.Figure 1: Overview of the proposed ECGAN. It consists of a parameter-sharing encoder E, an edge generator G e , an image generator G i , an attention guided edge transfer module G t , a label generator G l , a similarity loss module, a contrastive learning module G c (not shown for brevity), and a multimodality discriminator D. G e and G i are connected by G t from two levels, i.e., edge feature-level and content-level, to generate realistic images. G s is proposed to preserve the semantic information of the input semantic labels. G l aims to transfer the generated image back to the label for calculating the similarity loss. G c tries to capture more semantic relations by explicitly exploring the structures of labeled pixels from multiple input semantic layouts. D aims to distinguish the outputs from two modalities, i.e., edge and image. The symbol c denotes channel-wise concatenation.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Xun Huang and Serge Belongie.

253523259,Introducing Semantics into Speech Encoders,"Recent studies find existing self-supervised speech encoders contain primarily acoustic rather than semantic information. As a result, pipelined supervised automatic speech recognition (ASR) to large language model (LLM) systems achieve state-of-the-art results on semantic spoken language tasks by utilizing rich semantic representations from the LLM. These systems come at the cost of labeled audio transcriptions, which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. We propose a taskagnostic unsupervised way of incorporating semantic information from LLMs into selfsupervised speech encoders without labeled audio transcriptions. By introducing semantics, we improve existing speech encoder spoken language understanding (SLU) performance by over 5% on intent classification (IC), with modest gains in named entity resolution (NER) and slot filling (SF), and spoken question answering (SQA) FF1 score by over 2%. Our approach, which uses no ASR data, achieves similar performance as methods trained on over 100 hours of labeled audio transcripts, demonstrating the feasibility of unsupervised semantic augmentations to existing speech encoders.Conference on Acoustics, Speech and SignalProcessing (ICASSP), pages 7478-7482.

We provide expressions for the coefficients of this power series which depend on both the Hermite coefficients of the activation function as well as the depth of the network. We observe faster decay of the Hermite coefficients leads to faster decay in the NTK coefficients and explore the role of depth. Using this series, first we relate the effective rank of the NTK to the effective rank of the inputdata Gram. Second, for data drawn uniformly on the sphere we study the eigenvalues of the NTK, analyzing the impact of the choice of activation function. Finally, for generic data and activation functions with sufficiently fast Hermite coefficient decay, we derive an asymptotic upper bound on the spectrum of the NTK.",,,

While significant efforts have been made in understanding zero-sum two-player matrix games, the performance in zero-sum multiagent games remains inadequately explored, especially in the presence of delayed feedbacks, leaving the scalability and resiliency of gradient play open to questions. In this paper, we make progress by studying asynchronous gradient plays in zero-sum polymatrix games under delayed feedbacks. We first establish that the last iterate of entropy-regularized optimistic multiplicative weight updates (OMWU) method converges linearly to the quantal response equilibrium (QRE), the solution concept under bounded rationality, in the absence of delays. While the linear convergence continues to hold even when the feedbacks are randomly delayed under mild statistical assumptions, it converges at a noticeably slower rate due to a smaller tolerable range of learning rates. Moving beyond, we demonstrate entropy-regularized OMWUby adopting two-timescale learning rates in a delay-aware manner-enjoys faster last-iterate convergence under fixed delays, and continues to converge provably even when the delays are arbitrarily bounded in an average-iterate manner. Our methods also lead to finite-time guarantees to approximate the Nash equilibrium (NE) by moderating the amount of regularization. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first that aims to understand asynchronous gradient play in zero-sum polymatrix games under a wide range of delay assumptions, highlighting the role of learning rates separation.",,,
253581399,Efficient Transformers with Dynamic Token Pooling,"Transformers achieve unrivalled performance in modelling language, but remain inefficient in terms of memory and time complexity. A possible remedy is to reduce the sequence length in the intermediate layers by pooling fixed-length segments of tokens. Nevertheless, natural units of meaning, such as words or phrases, display varying sizes. To address this mismatch, we equip language models with a dynamic-pooling mechanism, which predicts segment boundaries in an autoregressive fashion. We compare several methods to infer boundaries, including end-to-end learning through stochastic re-parameterisation, supervised learning (based on segmentations from subword tokenizers or spikes in conditional entropy), as well as linguistically motivated boundaries. We perform character-level evaluation on texts from multiple datasets and morphologically diverse languages. The results demonstrate that dynamic pooling, which jointly segments and models language, is both faster and more accurate than vanilla Transformers and fixed-length pooling within the same computational budget.",,,

Inspired by the ""easy-to-hard"" intuition, we propose to do in-sample curriculum learning for natural language generation tasks.

253734483,Multi-Level Knowledge Distillation for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Text,"Self-supervised representation learning has proved to be a valuable component for outof-distribution (OoD) detection with only the texts of in-distribution (ID) examples. These approaches either train a language model from scratch or fine-tune a pre-trained language model using ID examples, and then take the perplexity output by the language model as OoD scores. In this paper, we analyze the complementary characteristics of both OoD detection methods and propose a multi-level knowledge distillation approach that integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. Specifically, we use a fine-tuned model as the teacher to teach a randomly initialized student model on the ID examples. Besides the prediction layer distillation, we present a similarity-based intermediate layer distillation method to thoroughly explore the representation space of the teacher model. In this way, the learned student can better represent the ID data manifold while gaining a stronger ability to map OoD examples outside the ID data manifold with the regularization inherited from pre-training. Besides, the student model sees only ID examples during parameter learning, further promoting more distinguishable features for OoD detection. We conduct extensive experiments over multiple benchmark datasets, i.e., CLINC150, SST, ROSTD, 20 NewsGroups, and AG News; showing that the proposed method yields new state-of-the-art performance 1 . We also explore its application as an AIGC detector to distinguish between answers generated by ChatGPT and human experts.

254044147,DiffusionBERT: Improving Generative Masked Language Models with Diffusion Models,"We present DiffusionBERT, a new generative masked language model based on discrete diffusion models. Diffusion models and many pre-trained language models have a shared training objective, i.e., denoising, making it possible to combine the two powerful models and enjoy the best of both worlds. On the one hand, diffusion models offer a promising training strategy that helps improve the generation quality. On the other hand, pre-trained denoising language models (e.g., BERT) can be used as a good initialization that accelerates convergence. We explore training BERT to learn the reverse process of a discrete diffusion process with an absorbing state and elucidate several designs to improve it. First, we propose a new noise schedule for the forward diffusion process that controls the degree of noise added at each step based on the information of each token. Second, we investigate several designs of incorporating the time step into BERT. Experiments on unconditional text generation demonstrate that DiffusionBERT achieves significant improvement over existing diffusion models for text (e.g., D3PM and Diffusion-LM) and previous generative masked language models in terms of perplexity and BLEU score. 1",,,

Here we study their properties through their Gaussian Process and Neural Tangent kernels. We derive explicit formulas for these kernels, analyze their spectra and provide bounds on their implied condition numbers. Our results indicate that (1) with ReLU activation, the eigenvalues of these residual kernels decay polynomially at a similar rate as the same kernels when skip connections are not used, thus maintaining a similar frequency bias; (2) however, residual kernels are more locally biased. Our analysis further shows that the matrices obtained by these residual kernels yield favorable condition numbers at finite depths than those obtained without the skip connections, enabling therefore faster convergence of training with gradient descent.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023",,,

We introduce CREPE, a QA dataset containing a natural distribution of presupposition failures from online information-seeking forums. We find that 25% of questions contain false presuppositions, and provide annotations for these presuppositions and their corrections. Through extensive baseline experiments, we show that adaptations of existing open-domain QA models can find presuppositions moderately well, but struggle when predicting whether a presupposition is factually correct. This is in large part due to difficulty in retrieving relevant evidence passages from a large text corpus.

254198988,OVER-TRAINING WITH MIXUP MAY HURT GENERALIZATION,"Mixup, which creates synthetic training instances by linearly interpolating random sample pairs, is a simple and yet effective regularization technique to boost the performance of deep models trained with SGD. In this work, we report a previously unobserved phenomenon in Mixup training: on a number of standard datasets, the performance of Mixup-trained models starts to decay after training for a large number of epochs, giving rise to a U-shaped generalization curve. This behavior is further aggravated when the size of original dataset is reduced. To help understand such a behavior of Mixup, we show theoretically that Mixup training may introduce undesired data-dependent label noises to the synthesized data. Via analyzing a least-square regression problem with a random feature model, we explain why noisy labels may cause the U-shaped curve to occur: Mixup improves generalization through fitting the clean patterns at the early training stage, but as training progresses, Mixup becomes over-fitting to the noise in the synthetic data. Extensive experiments are performed on a variety of benchmark datasets, validating this explanation. * Equal contribution.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 epochs, the generalization performance of the network measured by its testing error may exhibit a U-shaped curve.Figure 1shows such a curve obtained from over-training ResNet18 with Mixup on CIFAR10. As can be seen fromFigure 1, after training with Mixup for a long time (200 epochs), both ERM and Mixup keep decreasing their training loss, but the testing error of the Mixup-trained ResNet18 gradually increases, while that of the ERM-trained ResNet18 continues to decrease.Motivated by this observation, we conduct a theoretical analysis, aiming to better understand the aforementioned behavior of Mixup training. We show theoretically that Mixup training may introduce undesired data-dependent label noises to the synthesized data. Then by analyzing the gradientdescent dynamics of training a random feature model for a least-square regression problem, we explain why noisy labels may cause the U-shaped curve to occur: under label noise, the early phase of training is primarily driven by the clean data pattern, which moves the model parameter closer to the correct solution. But as training progresses, the effect of label noise accumulates through iterations and gradually over-weighs that of the clean pattern and dominates the late training process. In this phase, the model parameter gradually moves away from the correct solution until it is sufficient apart and approaches a location depending on the noise realization.",,,
254221009,Arxiv Submission AGRO: ADVERSARIAL DISCOVERY OF ERROR-PRONE GROUPS FOR ROBUST OPTIMIZATION,"Models trained via empirical risk minimization (ERM) are known to rely on spurious correlations between labels and task-independent input features, resulting in poor generalization to distributional shifts. Group distributionally robust optimization (G-DRO) can alleviate this problem by minimizing the worst-case loss over a set of pre-defined groups over training data. G-DRO successfully improves performance of the worst-group, where the correlation does not hold. However, G-DRO assumes that the spurious correlations and associated worst groups are known in advance, making it challenging to apply it to new tasks with potentially multiple unknown spurious correlations. We propose AGRO-Adversarial Group discovery for Distributionally Robust Optimization-an end-to-end approach that jointly identifies error-prone groups and improves accuracy on them. AGRO equips G-DRO with an adversarial slicing model to find a group assignment for training examples which maximizes worst-case loss over the discovered groups. On the WILDS benchmark, AGRO results in 8% higher model performance on average on known worst-groups, compared to prior group discovery approaches used with G-DRO. AGRO also improves out-of-distribution performance on SST2, QQP, and MS-COCO-datasets where potential spurious correlations are as yet uncharacterized.

To cope with the vast search space, existing work usually adopts a two-stage approach: it first retrieves a relatively small subgraph related to the question and then performs the reasoning on the subgraph to find the answer entities accurately. Although these two stages are highly related, previous work employs very different technical solutions for developing the retrieval and reasoning models, neglecting their relatedness in task essence. In this paper, we propose UniKGQA, a novel approach for multi-hop KGQA task, by unifying retrieval and reasoning in both model architecture and parameter learning. For model architecture, UniKGQA consists of a semantic matching module based on a pre-trained language model (PLM) for question-relation semantic matching, and a matching information propagation module to propagate the matching information along the directed edges on KGs. For parameter learning, we design a shared pre-training task based on questionrelation matching for both retrieval and reasoning models, and then propose retrieval-and reasoning-oriented fine-tuning strategies. Compared with previous studies, our approach is more unified, tightly relating the retrieval and reasoning stages.

Predicting these classes from data remains an essential open challenge in computational physics on which existing time-series classification methods struggle. Here, we propose, phase2vec, an embedding method that learns highquality, physically-meaningful representations of low-dimensional dynamical systems without supervision. Our embeddings are produced by a convolutional backbone that extracts geometric features from flow data and minimizes a physicallyinformed vector field reconstruction loss. The trained architecture can not only predict the equations of unseen data, but also produces embeddings that encode meaningful physical properties of input data (e.g. stability of fixed points, conservation of energy, and the incompressibility of flows) more faithfully than standard blackbox classifiers and state-of-the-art time series classification techniques.

We perform a finegrained comparison of language models and humans on seven pragmatic phenomena, using zero-shot prompting on an expert-curated set of English materials. We ask whether models (1) select pragmatic interpretations of speaker utterances, (2) make similar error patterns as humans, and (3) use similar linguistic cues as humans to solve the tasks. We find that the largest models achieve high accuracy and match human error patterns: within incorrect responses, models favor literal interpretations over heuristic-based distractors. We also find preliminary evidence that models and humans are sensitive to similar linguistic cues. Our results suggest that pragmatic behaviors can emerge in models without explicitly constructed representations of mental states.

Yet imperceptible adversarial perturbations can significantly reduce CLIP's performance on new tasks. In this work, we identify and explore the problem of adapting large-scale models for zero-shot adversarial robustness. We first identify two key factors during model adaption-training losses and adaptation methods-that affect the model's zero-shot adversarial robustness. We then propose a text-guided contrastive adversarial training loss, which aligns the text embeddings and the adversarial visual features with contrastive learning on a small set of training data. We apply this training loss to two adaption methods, model finetuning and visual prompt tuning. We find that visual prompt tuning is more effective in the absence of texts, while finetuning wins in the existence of text guidance. Overall, our approach significantly improves the zero-shot adversarial robustness over CLIP, seeing an average improvement of 31 points over ImageNet and 15 zero-shot datasets.

254685574,Attention as a Guide for Simultaneous Speech Translation,"In simultaneous speech translation (SimulST), effective policies that determine when to write partial translations are crucial to reach high output quality with low latency. Towards this objective, we propose EDATT (Encoder-Decoder Attention), an adaptive policy that exploits the attention patterns between audio source and target textual translation to guide an offlinetrained ST model during simultaneous inference. EDATT exploits the attention scores modeling the audio-translation relation to decide whether to emit a partial hypothesis or wait for more audio input. This is done under the assumption that, if attention is focused towards the most recently received speech segments, the information they provide can be insufficient to generate the hypothesis (indicating that the system has to wait for additional audio input). Results on en→{de, es} show that EDATT yields better results compared to the SimulST state of the art, with gains respectively up to 7 and 4 BLEU points for the two languages, and with a reduction in computational-aware latency up to 1.4s and 0.7s compared to existing SimulST policies applied to offline-trained models.",,,
254685611,,"Human evaluation is the foundation upon which the evaluation of both summarization systems and automatic metrics rests. However, existing human evaluation studies for summarization either exhibit a low inter-annotator agreement or have insufficient scale, and an in-depth analysis of human evaluation is lacking. Therefore, we address the shortcomings of existing summarization evaluation along the following axes: (1) We propose a modified summarization salience protocol, Atomic Content Units (ACUs), which is based on fine-grained semantic units and allows for a high interannotator agreement. (2) We curate the Robust Summarization Evaluation (RoSE) benchmark, a large human evaluation dataset consisting of 22,000 summary-level annotations over 28 top-performing systems on three datasets.(3) We conduct a comparative study of four human evaluation protocols, underscoring potential confounding factors in evaluation setups.(4) We evaluate 50 automatic metrics and their variants using the collected human annotations across evaluation protocols and demonstrate how our benchmark leads to more statistically stable and significant results. The metrics we benchmarked include recent methods based on large language models (LLMs), GPTScore and G-Eval. Furthermore, our findings have important implications for evaluating LLMs, as we show that LLMs adjusted by human feedback (e.g., GPT-3.5) may overfit unconstrained human evaluation, which is affected by the annotators' prior, input-agnostic preferences, calling for more robust, targeted evaluation methods.Oscar collided with Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina in the 16th minute of the London derby.

254685691,Summary-Oriented Vision Modeling for Multimodal Abstractive Summarization,"Multimodal abstractive summarization (MAS) aims to produce a concise summary given the multimodal data (text and vision). Existing studies mainly focus on how to effectively use the visual features from the perspective of an article, having achieved impressive success on the high-resource English dataset. However, less attention has been paid to the visual features from the perspective of the summary, which may limit the model performance, especially in the low-and zero-resource scenarios. In this paper, we propose to improve the summary quality through summary-oriented visual features. To this end, we devise two auxiliary tasks including vision to summary task and masked image modeling task. Together with the main summarization task, we optimize the MAS model via the training objectives of all these tasks. By these means, the MAS model can be enhanced by capturing the summaryoriented visual features, thereby yielding more accurate summaries. Experiments on 44 languages, covering mid-high-, low-, and zeroresource scenarios, verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance under all scenarios. Additionally, we will contribute a large-scale multilingual multimodal abstractive summarization (MM-Sum) dataset. 1",,,
254823170,"Detecting and Mitigating Hallucinations in Machine Translation: Model Internal Workings Alone Do Well, Sentence Similarity Even Better","While the problem of hallucinations in neural machine translation has long been recognized, so far the progress on its alleviation is very little. Indeed, recently it turned out that without artificially encouraging models to hallucinate, previously existing methods fall short and even the standard sequence log-probability is more informative. It means that internal characteristics of the model can give much more information than we expect, and before using external models and measures, we first need to ask: how far can we go if we use nothing but the translation model itself ? We propose to use a method that evaluates the percentage of the source contribution to a generated translation. Intuitively, hallucinations are translations ""detached"" from the source, hence they can be identified by low source contribution. This method improves detection accuracy for the most severe hallucinations by a factor of 2 and is able to alleviate hallucinations at test time on par with the previous best approach that relies on external models. Next, if we move away from internal model characteristics and allow external tools, we show that using sentence similarity from cross-lingual embeddings further improves these results. We release the code of our experiments. 1",,,
254853929,A Proposal for Grounding Language Models to Real-World Environments,"A key missing capacity of current language models (LMs) is grounding to real-world environments. Most existing work for grounded language understanding uses LMs to directly generate plans that can be executed in the environment to achieve the desired effects. It thereby casts the burden of ensuring grammaticality, faithfulness, and controllability all on the LMs. We propose Pangu, a generic framework for grounded language understanding that capitalizes on the discriminative ability of LMs instead of their generative ability. Pangu consists of a symbolic agent and a neural LM working in a concerted fashion: The agent explores the environment to incrementally construct valid plans, and the LM evaluates the plausibility of the candidate plans to guide the search process. A case study on the challenging problem of knowledge base question answering (KBQA), which features a massive environment, demonstrates the remarkable effectiveness and flexibility of Pangu: A BERT-base LM is sufficient for setting a new record on standard KBQA datasets, and larger LMs further bring substantial gains. Pangu also enables, for the first time, effective few-shot in-context learning for KBQA with large LMs such as Codex. 1   . 2008.

254854220,Speech Aware Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC11),"Most research on task oriented dialog modeling is based on written text input. However, users interact with practical dialog systems often using speech as input. Typically, systems convert speech into text using an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system, introducing errors. Furthermore, these systems do not address the differences in written and spoken language. The research on this topic is stymied by the lack of a public corpus. Motivated by these considerations, our goal in hosting the speech-aware dialog state tracking challenge was to create a public corpus or task which can be used to investigate the performance gap between the written and spoken forms of input, develop models that could alleviate this gap, and establish whether Textto-Speech-based (TTS) systems is a reasonable surrogate to the more-labor intensive human data collection. We created three spoken versions of the popular written-domain Mul-tiWoz task -(a) TTS-Verbatim: written user inputs were converted into speech waveforms using a TTS system, (b) Human-Verbatim: humans spoke the user inputs verbatim, and (c) Human-paraphrased: humans paraphrased the user inputs. Additionally, we provided different forms of ASR output to encourage wider participation from teams that may not have access to state-of-the-art ASR systems. These included ASR transcripts, word time stamps, and latent representations of the audio (audio encoder outputs). In this paper, we describe the corpus, report results from participating teams, provide preliminary analyses of their results, and summarize the current state-of-the-art in this domain.",,,
254854340,Chat-Oriented Dialogue Systems,"Despite tremendous advancements in dialogue systems, stable evaluation still requires human judgments producing notoriously high-variance metrics due to their inherent subjectivity. Moreover, methods and labels in dialogue evaluation are not fully standardized, especially for opendomain chats, with a lack of work to compare and assess the validity of those approaches. The use of inconsistent evaluation can misinform the performance of a dialogue system, which becomes a major hurdle to enhance it. Thus, a dimensional evaluation of chat-oriented opendomain dialogue systems that reliably measures several aspects of dialogue capabilities is desired. This paper presents a novel human evaluation method to estimate the rates of many dialogue system behaviors. Our method is used to evaluate four state-of-the-art open-domain dialogue systems and compared with existing approaches. The analysis demonstrates that our behavior method is more suitable than alternative Likert-style or comparative approaches for dimensional evaluation of these systems.A detailed validation of human evaluation meth-ods, including likert scales and pairwise comparisons (Section 7).A comprehensive evaluation of four MTOD chatbots using validated metrics (Section 8).By presenting a detailed picture of MTOD chatbot performance and standard methods to evaluate them, we aid future work's efforts to further understand and improve human-computer interaction.

Candidate chatbots are selected from each theme using the following criteria:1. The bot must demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in a task related to the theme. 1 2.

254854514,WACO: Word-Aligned Contrastive Learning for Speech Translation,"End-to-end Speech Translation (E2E ST) aims to directly translate source speech into target text. Existing ST methods perform poorly when only extremely small speech-text data are available for training. We observe that an ST model's performance closely correlates with its embedding similarity between speech and source transcript. In this paper, we propose Word-Aligned COntrastive learning (WACO), a simple and effective method for extremely low-resource speech-to-text translation. Our key idea is bridging word-level representations for both speech and text modalities via contrastive learning. We evaluate WACO and other methods on the MuST-C dataset, a widely used ST benchmark, and on a low-resource direction Maltese-English from IWSLT 2023. Our experiments demonstrate that WACO outperforms the best baseline by 9+ BLEU points with only 1-hour parallel ST data. Code is available at https://github.com/owaski/WACO.",,,
254877039,DISCO: Distilling Counterfactuals with Large Language Models,"Models trained with counterfactually augmented data learn representations of the causal structure of tasks, enabling robust generalization. However, high-quality counterfactual data is scarce for most tasks and not easily generated at scale. When crowdsourced, such data is typically limited in scale and diversity; when generated using supervised methods, it is computationally expensive to extend to new counterfactual dimensions. In this work, we introduce DISCO (DIStilled COunterfactual Data), a new method for automatically generating highquality counterfactual data at scale. DISCO engineers prompts to generate phrasal perturbations with a large general language model. Then, a task-specific teacher model filters these generations to distill high-quality counterfactual data. While task-agnostic, we apply our pipeline to the task of natural language inference (NLI) and find that on challenging evaluations such as the NLI stress test, comparatively smaller student models trained with DISCOgenerated counterfactuals are more robust (6% absolute) and generalize better across distributions (2%) compared to models trained without data augmentation. Furthermore, DISCOaugmented models are 10% more consistent between counterfactual pairs on three evaluation sets, demonstrating that DISCO augmentation enables models to more reliably learn causal representations.

To support this, we first create a benchmark dataset for this task by adapting the existing CommonGen dataset. We then propose a two-stage model called MoREE to generate the target sentences. MoREE consists of a mixture of retrievers model that retrieves diverse context sentences related to the given concepts, and a mixture of generators model that generates diverse sentences based on the retrieved contexts. We conduct experiments on the DimonGen task and show that MoREE outperforms strong baselines in terms of both the quality and diversity of the generated sentences. Our results demonstrate that MoREE is able to generate diverse sentences that reflect different relationships between concepts, leading to a comprehensive understanding of concept relationships. 1",,,

The development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of solving math problems and proving theorems in language has garnered significant interest in the fields of machine learning and natural language processing. For example, mathematics serves as a testbed for aspects of reasoning that are challenging for powerful deep learning models, driving new algorithmic and modeling advances. On the other hand, recent advances in large-scale neural language models have opened up new benchmarks and opportunities to use deep learning for mathematical reasoning. In this survey paper, we review the key tasks, datasets, and methods at the intersection of mathematical reasoning and deep learning over the past decade.

We examine a range of recently proposed evaluation metrics based on pretrained language models, for the tasks of open-ended generation, translation, and summarization. Our experiments reveal interesting insensitivities, biases, or even loopholes in existing metrics. For example, we find that BERTScore is confused by truncation errors in summarization, and MAUVE (built on top of GPT-2) is insensitive to errors at the beginning or middle of generations. Further, we investigate the reasons behind these blind spots and suggest practical workarounds for a more reliable evaluation of text generation.

254877347,DIONYSUS: A Pre-trained Model for Low-Resource Dialogue Summarization,"Dialogue summarization has recently garnered significant attention due to its wide range of applications. However, existing methods for summarizing dialogues have limitations because they do not take into account the inherent structure of dialogue and rely heavily on labeled data, which can lead to poor performance in new domains. In this work, we propose DIONYSUS (dynamic input optimization in pre-training for dialogue summarization), a pre-trained encoder-decoder model for summarizing dialogues in any new domain. To pretrain DIONYSUS, we create two pseudo summaries for each dialogue example: one from a fine-tuned summarization model and the other from important dialogue turns. We then choose one of these pseudo summaries based on information distribution differences in different types of dialogues. This selected pseudo summary serves as the objective for pre-training DIONYSUS using a self-supervised approach on a large dialogue corpus. Our experiments show that DIONYSUS outperforms existing methods on six datasets, as demonstrated by its ROUGE scores in zero-shot and few-shot settings.",,,
254877406,ByGPT5: End-to-End Style-conditioned Poetry Generation with Token-free Language Models,"State-of-the-art poetry generation systems are often complex. They either consist of taskspecific model pipelines, incorporate prior knowledge in the form of manually created constraints, or both. In contrast, end-to-end models would not suffer from the overhead of having to model prior knowledge and could learn the nuances of poetry from data alone, reducing the degree of human supervision required. In this work, we investigate end-to-end poetry generation conditioned on styles such as rhyme, meter, and alliteration. We identify and address lack of training data and mismatching tokenization algorithms as possible limitations of past attempts. In particular, we successfully pre-train ByGPT5, a new token-free decoder-only language model, and fine-tune it on a large custom corpus of English and German quatrains annotated with our styles. We show that ByGPT5 outperforms other models such as mT5, ByT5, GPT-2 and ChatGPT, while also being more parameter efficient and performing favorably compared to humans. In addition, we analyze its runtime performance and demonstrate that it is not prone to memorization. We make our code, models, and datasets publicly available.1",,,
254877569,Towards Understanding Chain-of-Thought Prompting: An Empirical Study of What Matters,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can dramatically improve the multi-step reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). CoT explicitly encourages the LLM to generate intermediate rationales for solving a problem, by providing a series of reasoning steps in the demonstrations. Despite its success, there is still little understanding of what makes CoT prompting effective and which aspects of the demonstrated reasoning steps contribute to its performance. In this paper, we show that CoT reasoning is possible even with invalid demonstrations-prompting with invalid reasoning steps can achieve over 80-90% of the performance obtained using CoT under various metrics, while still generating coherent lines of reasoning during inference. Further experiments show that other aspects of the rationales, such as being relevant to the query and correctly ordering the reasoning steps, are much more important for effective CoT reasoning. Overall, these findings both deepen our understanding of CoT prompting, and open up new questions regarding LLMs' capability to learn to reason in context. 1",,,
254926490,TASK AMBIGUITY IN HUMANS AND LANGUAGE MODELS,"Language models have recently achieved strong performance across a wide range of NLP benchmarks. However, unlike benchmarks, real world tasks are often poorly specified, and agents must deduce the user's intended behavior from a combination of context, instructions, and examples. We investigate how both humans and models behave in the face of such task ambiguity by proposing AmbiBench, a new benchmark of six ambiguously-specified classification tasks. We evaluate humans and models on AmbiBench by seeing how well they identify the intended task using 1) instructions with varying degrees of ambiguity, and 2) different numbers of labeled examples. We find that the combination of model scaling (to 175B parameters) and training with human feedback data enables models to approach or exceed the accuracy of human participants across tasks, but that either one alone is not sufficient. In addition, we show how to dramatically improve the accuracy of language models trained without large-scale human feedback training by finetuning on a small number of ambiguous in-context examples, providing a promising direction for teaching models to generalize well in the face of ambiguity.",,,
255416037,AUTOMATING NEAREST NEIGHBOR SEARCH CONFIG- URATION WITH CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION,"The approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search problem is fundamental to efficiently serving many real-world machine learning applications. A number of techniques have been developed for ANN search that are efficient, accurate, and scalable. However, such techniques typically have a number of parameters that affect the speed-recall tradeoff, and exhibit poor performance when such parameters aren't properly set. Tuning these parameters has traditionally been a manual process, demanding in-depth knowledge of the underlying search algorithm. This is becoming an increasingly unrealistic demand as ANN search grows in popularity. To tackle this obstacle to ANN adoption, this work proposes a constrained optimization-based approach to tuning quantization-based ANN algorithms. Our technique takes just a desired search cost or recall as input, and then generates tunings that, empirically, are very close to the speed-recall Pareto frontier and give leading performance on standard benchmarks. Table 1: Our technique is the first to use minimal computational cost and human involvement to configure an ANN index to perform very close to its speed-recall Pareto frontier. Method Computational Cost of Tuning Human Involvement Hyperparameter Quality Grid search High Low High Manual tuning Low High Medium Black-box optimizer Medium Low Medium Ours Low Low High during the tuning process, necessitating extensive human-in-the-loop expertise, or giving suboptimal hyperparameters.Mitigating these issues is becoming increasingly important with the growth in dataset sizes and in the popularity of the ANN-based retrieval paradigm. This paper describes how highly performant ANN indices may be created and tuned with minimal configuration complexity to the end user. Our contributions are:• Deriving theoretically-grounded models for recall and search cost for quantization-based ANN algorithms, and presenting an efficient Lagrange multipliers-based technique for optimizing either of these metrics with respect to the other.",,,
255749563,NEURAL SYSTEMATIC BINDER,"The key to high-level cognition is believed to be the ability to systematically manipulate and compose knowledge pieces. While token-like structured knowledge representations are naturally provided in text, it is elusive how to obtain them for unstructured modalities such as scene images. In this paper, we propose a neural mechanism called Neural Systematic Binder or SysBinder for constructing a novel structured representation called Block-Slot Representation. In Block-Slot Representation, object-centric representations known as slots are constructed by composing a set of independent factor representations called blocks, to facilitate systematic generalization. SysBinder obtains this structure in an unsupervised way by alternatingly applying two different binding principles: spatial binding for spatial modularity across the full scene and factor binding for factor modularity within an object. SysBinder is a simple, deterministic, and general-purpose layer that can be applied as a drop-in module in any arbitrary neural network and on any modality. In experiments, we find that SysBinder provides significantly better factor disentanglement within the slots than the conventional object-centric methods, including, for the first time, in visually complex scene images such as CLEVR-Tex. Furthermore, we demonstrate factor-level systematicity in controlled scene generation by decoding unseen factor combinations. https://sites. .

The models' ability to process multiple languages relying on a shared set of parameters raises the question of whether the grammatical knowledge they extracted during pre-training can be considered as a data-driven cross-lingual grammar. The present work studies the inner workings of mBERT and XLM-R in order to test the cross-lingual consistency of the individual neural units that respond to a precise syntactic phenomenon, that is, number agreement, in five languages (English, German, French, Hebrew, Russian). We found that there is a significant overlap in the latent dimensions that encode agreement across the languages we considered. This overlap is larger (a) for long-vis-à-vis shortdistance agreement and (b) when considering XLM-R as compared to mBERT, and peaks in the intermediate layers of the network. We further show that a small set of syntax-sensitive neurons can capture agreement violations across languages; however, their contribution is not decisive in agreement processing.",,,
255998264,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 STRONG INDUCTIVE BIASES PROVABLY PREVENT HARMLESS INTERPOLATION,"Classical wisdom suggests that estimators should avoid fitting noise to achieve good generalization. In contrast, modern overparameterized models can yield small test error despite interpolating noise -a phenomenon often called ""benign overfitting"" or ""harmless interpolation"". This paper argues that the degree to which interpolation is harmless hinges upon the strength of an estimator's inductive bias, i.e., how heavily the estimator favors solutions with a certain structure: while strong inductive biases prevent harmless interpolation, weak inductive biases can even require fitting noise to generalize well. Our main theoretical result establishes tight non-asymptotic bounds for high-dimensional kernel regression that reflect this phenomenon for convolutional kernels, where the filter size regulates the strength of the inductive bias. We further provide empirical evidence of the same behavior for deep neural networks with varying filter sizes and rotational invariance. * Equal contribution; correspondence to research@michaelaerni.com",,,

Existing techniques to reduce ReLU operations often involve manual effort and sacrifice significant accuracy. In this paper, we first present a novel measure of non-linearity layers' ReLU sensitivity, enabling mitigation of the time-consuming manual efforts in identifying the same. Based on this sensitivity, we then present SENet, a three-stage training method that for a given ReLU budget, automatically assigns per-layer ReLU counts, decides the ReLU locations for each layer's activation map, and trains a model with significantly fewer ReLUs to potentially yield latency and communication efficient PI. Experimental evaluations with multiple models on various datasets show SENet's superior performance both in terms of reduced ReLUs and improved classification accuracy compared to existing alternatives. In particular, SENet can yield models that require up to ∼2× fewer Re-LUs while yielding similar accuracy.

Even though curriculum RL, a framework that solves complex tasks by proposing a sequence of surrogate tasks, shows reasonable results, most of the previous works still have difficulty in proposing curriculum due to the absence of a mechanism for obtaining calibrated guidance to the desired outcome state without any prior domain knowledge. To alleviate it, we propose an uncertainty & temporal distance-aware curriculum goal generation method for the outcomedirected RL via solving a bipartite matching problem. It could not only provide precisely calibrated guidance of the curriculum to the desired outcome states but also bring much better sample efficiency and geometry-agnostic curriculum goal proposal capability compared to previous curriculum RL methods. We demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms these prior methods in a variety of challenging navigation tasks and robotic manipulation tasks in a quantitative and qualitative way. 1 * Equal contribution.",,,
256416103,WHEN SOURCE-FREE DOMAIN ADAPTATION MEETS LEARNING WITH NOISY LABELS,"Recent state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) methods have focused on learning meaningful cluster structures in the feature space, which have succeeded in adapting the knowledge from source domain to unlabeled target domain without accessing the private source data. However, existing methods rely on the pseudo-labels generated by source models that can be noisy due to domain shift. In this paper, we study SFDA from the perspective of learning with label noise (LLN). Unlike the label noise in the conventional LLN scenario, we prove that the label noise in SFDA follows a different distribution assumption. We also prove that such a difference makes existing LLN methods that rely on their distribution assumptions unable to address the label noise in SFDA. Empirical evidence suggests that only marginal improvements are achieved when applying the existing LLN methods to solve the SFDA problem. On the other hand, although there exists a fundamental difference between the label noise in the two scenarios, we demonstrate theoretically that the early-time training phenomenon (ETP), which has been previously observed in conventional label noise settings, can also be observed in the SFDA problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements to existing SFDA algorithms by leveraging ETP to address the label noise in SFDA. .

Recently, several works explore the usage of neural radiance field in this task to improve 3D realness and image fidelity. However, the generalizability of previous NeRF-based methods to out-of-domain audio is limited by the small scale of training data. In this work, we propose Gene-Face, a generalized and high-fidelity NeRF-based talking face generation method, which can generate natural results corresponding to various out-of-domain audio. Specifically, we learn a variaitional motion generator on a large lip-reading corpus, and introduce a domain adaptative post-net to calibrate the result. Moreover, we learn a NeRF-based renderer conditioned on the predicted facial motion. A head-aware torso-NeRF is proposed to eliminate the head-torso separation problem.

To summarize, the current NeRF-based methods are challenged with the weak generalizability problem due to the lack of audio-to-motion training data and the ""mean face"" results due to the one-to-many mapping.In this work, we develop a talking face generation system called GeneFace to address these two challenges. To handle the weak generalizability problem, we devise an audio-to-motion model to predict the 3D facial landmark given the input audio. We utilize hundreds of hours of audio-motion pairs from a large-scale lip reading datasetAfouras et al.(2018)to learn a robust mapping. As for the ""mean face"" problem, instead of using the regression-based model, we adopt a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a flow-based prior as the architecture of the audio-to-motion model, which helps generate accurate and expressive facial motions. However, due to the domain shift between the generated landmarks (in the multi-speaker domain) and the training set of NeRF (in the target person domain), we found that the NeRF-based renderer fails to generate high-fidelity frames given the predicted landmarks. Therefore, a domain adaptation process is proposed to rig the predicted landmarks into the target person's distribution. To summarize, our system consists of three stages:",,,

Although many approaches have been proposed to make ML models fair, they typically rely on the assumption that data distributions in training and deployment are identical. Unfortunately, this is commonly violated in practice and a model that is fair during training may lead to an unexpected outcome during its deployment. Although the problem of designing robust ML models under dataset shifts has been widely studied, most existing works focus only on the transfer of accuracy.In this paper, we study the transfer of both fairness and accuracy under domain generalization where the data at test time may be sampled from never-before-seen domains. We first develop theoretical bounds on the unfairness and expected loss at deployment, and then derive sufficient conditions under which fairness and accuracy can be perfectly transferred via invariant representation learning. Guided by this, we design a learning algorithm such that fair ML models learned with training data still have high fairness and accuracy when deployment environments change. Experiments on real-world data validate the proposed algorithm. Model implementation is available at https://github.com/pth1993/FATDM.",,,
256461055,VIRT: Improving Representation-based Text Matching via Virtual Interaction,"Text matching is a fundamental research problem in natural language understanding. Interaction-based approaches treat the text pair as a single sequence and encode it through cross encoders, while representation-based models encode the text pair independently with siamese or dual encoders. Interactionbased models require dense computations and thus are impractical in real-world applications. Representation-based models have become the mainstream paradigm for efficient text matching. However, these models suffer from severe performance degradation due to the lack of interactions between the pair of texts. To remedy this, we propose a Virtual InteRacTion mechanism (VIRT) for improving representation-based text matching while maintaining its efficiency. In particular, we introduce an interactive knowledge distillation module that is only applied during training. It enables deep interaction between texts by effectively transferring knowledge from the interaction-based model. A light interaction strategy is designed to fully leverage the learned interactive knowledge. Experimental results on six text matching benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method over several state-of-the-art representationbased models. We further show that VIRT can be integrated into existing methods as plugins to lift their performances.",,,
256503523,Neural Common Neighbor with Completion for Link Prediction,"Despite its outstanding performance in various graph tasks, vanilla Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) usually fails in link prediction tasks, as it only uses representations of two individual target nodes and ignores the pairwise relation between them. To capture the pairwise relations, some models add manual features to the input graph and use the output of MPNN to produce pairwise representations. In contrast, others directly use manual features as pairwise representations. Though this simplification avoids applying a GNN to each link individually and thus improves scalability, these models still have much room for performance improvement due to the hand-crafted and unlearnable pairwise features. To upgrade performance while maintaining scalability, we propose Neural Common Neighbor (NCN), which uses learnable pairwise representations. To further boost NCN, we study the unobserved link problem. The incompleteness of the graph is ubiquitous and leads to distribution shifts between the training and test set, loss of common neighbor information, and performance degradation of models. Therefore, we propose two intervention methods: common neighbor completion and target link removal. Combining the two methods with NCN, we propose Neural Common Neighbor with Completion (NCNC). NCN and NCNC outperform recent strong baselines by large margins. NCNC achieves state-ofthe-art performance in link prediction tasks.

256503815,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 IMPLICIT REGULARIZATION IN HEAVY-BALL MOMEN- TUM ACCELERATED STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT,"It is well known that the finite step-size (h) in Gradient Descent (GD) implicitly regularizes solutions to flatter minima. A natural question to ask is ""Does the momentum parameter β play a role in implicit regularization in Heavy-ball (H.B) momentum accelerated gradient descent (GD+M)?"" To answer this question, first, we show that the discrete H.B momentum update (GD+M) follows a continuous trajectory induced by a modified loss, which consists of an original loss and an implicit regularizer. Then, we show that this implicit regularizer for (GD+M) is stronger than that of (GD) by factor of ( 1+β 1−β ), thus explaining why (GD+M) shows better generalization performance and higher test accuracy than (GD). Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the stochastic version of gradient descent with momentum (SGD+M) and characterize the continuous trajectory of the update of (SGD+M) in a pointwise sense. We explore the implicit regularization in (SGD+M) and (GD+M) through a series of experiments validating our theory.",,,
256503890,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 DE NOVO MOLECULAR GENERATION VIA CONNECTION-AWARE MOTIF MINING,"De novo molecular generation is an essential task for science discovery. Recently, fragment-based deep generative models have attracted much research attention due to their flexibility in generating novel molecules based on existing molecule fragments. However, the motif vocabulary, i.e., the collection of frequent fragments, is usually built upon heuristic rules, which brings difficulties to capturing common substructures from large amounts of molecules. In this work, we propose a new method, MiCaM, to generate molecules based on mined connection-aware motifs. Specifically, it leverages a data-driven algorithm to automatically discover motifs from a molecule library by iteratively merging subgraphs based on their frequency. The obtained motif vocabulary consists of not only molecular motifs (i.e., the frequent fragments), but also their connection information, indicating how the motifs are connected with each other. Based on the mined connectionaware motifs, MiCaM builds a connection-aware generator, which simultaneously picks up motifs and determines how they are connected. We test our method on distribution-learning benchmarks (i.e., generating novel molecules to resemble the distribution of a given training set) and goal-directed benchmarks (i.e., generating molecules with target properties), and achieve significant improvements over previous fragment-based baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can effectively mine domain-specific motifs for different tasks.

256597815,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 WHEN DATA GEOMETRY MEETS DEEP FUNCTION: GENERALIZING OFFLINE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING,"In offline reinforcement learning (RL), one detrimental issue to policy learning is the error accumulation of deep Q function in out-of-distribution (OOD) areas. Unfortunately, existing offline RL methods are often over-conservative, inevitably hurting generalization performance outside data distribution. In our study, one interesting observation is that deep Q functions approximate well inside the convex hull of training data. Inspired by this, we propose a new method, DOGE (Distance-sensitive Offline RL with better GEneralization). DOGE marries dataset geometry with deep function approximators in offline RL, and enables exploitation in generalizable OOD areas rather than strictly constraining policy within data distribution. Specifically, DOGE trains a state-conditioned distance function that can be readily plugged into standard actor-critic methods as a policy constraint. Simple yet elegant, our algorithm enjoys better generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods on D4RL benchmarks. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the superiority of our approach to existing methods that are solely based on data distribution or support constraints. Song.

256598058,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 ORDERED GNN: ORDERING MESSAGE PASSING TO DEAL WITH HETEROPHILY AND OVER-SMOOTHING,"Most graph neural networks follow the message passing mechanism. However, it faces the over-smoothing problem when multiple times of message passing is applied to a graph, causing indistinguishable node representations and prevents the model to effectively learn dependencies between farther-away nodes. On the other hand, features of neighboring nodes with different labels are likely to be falsely mixed, resulting in the heterophily problem. In this work, we propose to order the messages passing into the node representation, with specific blocks of neurons targeted for message passing within specific hops. This is achieved by aligning the hierarchy of the rooted-tree of a central node with the ordered neurons in its node representation. Experimental results on an extensive set of datasets show that our model can simultaneously achieve the state-of-the-art in both homophily and heterophily settings, without any targeted design. Moreover, its performance maintains pretty well while the model becomes really deep, effectively preventing the over-smoothing problem. Finally, visualizing the gating vectors shows that our model learns to behave differently between homophily and heterophily settings, providing an explainable graph neural model.",,,
256615568,REAL-TIME IMAGE DEMOIRÉING ON MOBILE DE- VICES,"Moiré patterns appear frequently when taking photos of digital screens, drastically degrading the image quality. Despite the advance of CNNs in image demoiréing, existing networks are with heavy design, causing redundant computation burden for mobile devices. In this paper, we launch the first study on accelerating demoiréing networks and propose a dynamic demoiréing acceleration method (DDA) towards a real-time deployment on mobile devices. Our stimulus stems from a simple-yet-universal fact that moiré patterns often unbalancedly distribute across an image. Consequently, excessive computation is wasted upon non-moiré areas. Therefore, we reallocate computation costs in proportion to the complexity of image patches. In order to achieve this aim, we measure the complexity of an image patch by designing a novel moiré prior that considers both colorfulness and frequency information of moiré patterns. Then, we restore image patches with higher-complexity using larger networks and the ones with lower-complexity are assigned with smaller networks to relieve the computation burden. At last, we train all networks in a parameter-shared supernet paradigm to avoid additional parameter burden. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed DDA. In addition, the acceleration evaluated on the VIVO X80 Pro smartphone equipped with a chip of Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 shows that our method can drastically reduce the inference time, leading to a real-time image demoiréing on mobile devices.

256615681,ON THE COMPLEXITY OF NONSMOOTH AUTOMATIC DIFFERENTIATION,"Using the notion of conservative gradient, we provide a simple model to estimate the computational costs of the backward and forward modes of algorithmic differentiation for a wide class of nonsmooth programs. The overhead complexity of the backward mode turns out to be independent of the dimension when using programs with locally Lipschitz semi-algebraic or definable elementary functions. This considerably extends Baur-Strassen's smooth cheap gradient principle. We illustrate our results by establishing fast backpropagation results of conservative gradients through feedforward neural networks with standard activation and loss functions. Nonsmooth backpropagation's cheapness contrasts with concurrent forward approaches, which have, to this day, dimensional-dependent worst-case overhead estimates. We provide further results suggesting the superiority of backward propagation of conservative gradients. Indeed, we relate the complexity of computing a large number of directional derivatives to that of matrix multiplication, and we show that finding two subgradients in the Clarke subdifferential of a function is an NP-hard problem.",,,
256616076,DOMAIN-INDEXING VARIATIONAL BAYES: INTER- PRETABLE DOMAIN INDEX FOR DOMAIN ADAPTATION,"Previous studies have shown that leveraging domain index can significantly boost domain adaptation performance (Wang et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2022). However, such domain indices are not always available. To address this challenge, we first provide a formal definition of domain index from the probabilistic perspective, and then propose an adversarial variational Bayesian framework that infers domain indices from multi-domain data, thereby providing additional insight on domain relations and improving domain adaptation performance. Our theoretical analysis shows that our adversarial variational Bayesian framework finds the optimal domain index at equilibrium. Empirical results on both synthetic and real data verify that our model can produce interpretable domain indices which enable us to achieve superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.

256808600,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 DEEP LEARNING ON IMPLICIT NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS OF SHAPES,"Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged in the last few years as a powerful tool to encode continuously a variety of different signals like images, videos, audio and 3D shapes. When applied to 3D shapes, INRs allow to overcome the fragmentation and shortcomings of the popular discrete representations used so far. Yet, considering that INRs consist in neural networks, it is not clear whether and how it may be possible to feed them into deep learning pipelines aimed at solving a downstream task. In this paper, we put forward this research problem and propose inr2vec, a framework that can compute a compact latent representation for an input INR in a single inference pass. We verify that inr2vec can embed effectively the 3D shapes represented by the input INRs and show how the produced embeddings can be fed into deep learning pipelines to solve several tasks by processing exclusively INRs.",,,
256868814,Measuring the Instability of Fine-Tuning,"Fine-tuning pre-trained language models on downstream tasks with varying random seeds has been shown to be unstable, especially on small datasets. Many previous studies have investigated this instability and proposed methods to mitigate it. However, most studies only used the standard deviation of performance scores (SD) as their measure, which is a narrow characterization of instability. In this paper, we analyze SD and six other measures quantifying instability at different levels of granularity. Moreover, we propose a systematic framework to evaluate the validity of these measures. Finally, we analyze the consistency and difference between different measures by reassessing existing instability mitigation methods. We hope our results will inform the development of better measurements of fine-tuning instability. 1Layer-wise Learning Rate Decay (Howard and Ruder, 2018, LLRD) assigns decreasing learning rates from the topmost layer to the bottom layer by a constant hyper-parameter discounting factor η. Howard and Ruder (2018) empirically show that models trained using LLRD are more stable, by retaining more generalizable pre-trained knowledge in bottom layers, while forgetting specialized pre-train knowledge in top layers.Re-init (Zhang et al., 2021) stabilizes fine-tuning by re-initializing the top k layers of PLMs. The underlying intuition is similar to LLRD: top layers of PLMs contain more pre-train task specific knowledge, and transferring it may hurt stability.",,,
256900870,Effective Data Augmentation With Diffusion Models,"Data augmentation is one of the most prevalent tools in deep learning, underpinning many recent advances, including those from classification, generative models, and representation learning. The standard approach to data augmentation combines simple transformations like rotations and flips to generate new images from existing ones. However, these new images lack diversity along key semantic axes present in the data. Current augmentations cannot alter the high-level semantic attributes, such as animal species present in a scene, to enhance the diversity of data. We address the lack of diversity in data augmentation with image-to-image transformations parameterized by pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. Our method edits images to change their semantics using an off-the-shelf diffusion model, and generalizes to novel visual concepts from a few labelled examples. We evaluate our approach on few-shot image classification tasks, and on a real-world weed recognition task, and observe an improvement in accuracy in tested domains.",,,
256900985,Learning to Initialize: Can Meta Learning Improve Cross-task Generalization in Prompt Tuning?,"Prompt tuning (PT) which only tunes the embeddings of an additional sequence of tokens per task, keeping the pre-trained language model (PLM) frozen, has shown remarkable performance in few-shot learning. Despite this, PT has been shown to rely heavily on good initialization of the prompt embeddings. In this work, we study meta prompt tuning (MPT) to systematically explore how meta-learning can help improve (if it can) cross-task generalization in PT through learning to initialize the prompt embeddings from other relevant tasks. We empirically analyze a representative set of meta learning algorithms in a wide range of adaptation settings with different source/target task configurations on a large set of few-shot tasks. With extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MPT. We find the improvement to be significant particularly on classification tasks. For other kinds of tasks such as question answering, we observe that while MPT can outperform PT in most cases, it does not always outperform multi-task learning.

256901172,Tree-Based Representation and Generation of Natural and Mathematical Language,"Mathematical language in scientific communications and educational scenarios is important yet relatively understudied compared to natural languages. Recent works on mathematical language focus either on representing stand-alone mathematical expressions, especially in their natural tree format, or mathematical reasoning in pre-trained natural language models. Existing works on jointly modeling and generating natural and mathematical languages simply treat mathematical expressions as text, without accounting for the rigid structural properties of mathematical expressions. In this paper, we propose a series of modifications to existing language models to jointly represent and generate text and math: representing mathematical expressions as sequences of node tokens in their operator tree format, using math symbol and tree position embeddings to preserve the semantic and structural properties of mathematical expressions, and using a constrained decoding method to generate mathematically valid expressions. We ground our modifications in GPT-2, resulting in a model MathGPT, and demonstrate that it outperforms baselines on mathematical expression generation tasks.",,,

However, even one of the most elementary RL algorithms, temporal-difference (TD) learning, is known to suffer form divergence issue when the off-policy scheme is used together with linear function approximation. To overcome the divergent behavior, several off-policy TD-learning algorithms, including gradient-TD learning (GTD), and TD-learning with correction (TDC), have been developed until now. In this work, we provide a unified view of such algorithms from a purely control-theoretic perspective, and propose a new convergent algorithm. Our method relies on the backstepping technique, which is widely used in nonlinear control theory. Finally, convergence of the proposed algorithm is experimentally verified in environments where the standard TD-learning is known to be unstable.",,,
257038905,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 IMPROVING DEEP POLICY GRADIENTS WITH VALUE FUNCTION SEARCH,"Deep Policy Gradient (PG) algorithms employ value networks to drive the learning of parameterized policies and reduce the variance of the gradient estimates. However, value function approximation gets stuck in local optima and struggles to fit the actual return, limiting the variance reduction efficacy and leading policies to sub-optimal performance. This paper focuses on improving value approximation and analyzing the effects on Deep PG primitives such as value prediction, variance reduction, and correlation of gradient estimates with the true gradient. To this end, we introduce a Value Function Search that employs a population of perturbed value networks to search for a better approximation. Our framework does not require additional environment interactions, gradient computations, or ensembles, providing a computationally inexpensive approach to enhance the supervised learning task on which value networks train. Crucially, we show that improving Deep PG primitives results in improved sample efficiency and policies with higher returns using common continuous control benchmark domains.",,,
257079046,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 RECON: REDUCING CONFLICTING GRADIENTS FROM THE ROOT FOR MULTI-TASK LEARNING,"A fundamental challenge for multi-task learning is that different tasks may conflict with each other when they are solved jointly, and a cause of this phenomenon is conflicting gradients during optimization. Recent works attempt to mitigate the influence of conflicting gradients by directly altering the gradients based on some criteria. However, our empirical study shows that ""gradient surgery"" cannot effectively reduce the occurrence of conflicting gradients. In this paper, we take a different approach to reduce conflicting gradients from the root. In essence, we investigate the task gradients w.r.t. each shared network layer, select the layers with high conflict scores, and turn them to task-specific layers. Our experiments show that such a simple approach can greatly reduce the occurrence of conflicting gradients in the remaining shared layers and achieve better performance, with only a slight increase in model parameters in many cases. Our approach can be easily applied to improve various state-of-the-art methods including gradient manipulation methods and branched architecture search methods. Given a network architecture (e.g., ResNet18), it only needs to search for the conflict layers once, and the network can be modified to be used with different methods on the same or even different datasets to gain performance improvement. The source code is available at https://github.com/moukamisama/Recon.We propose a different approach to reduce conflicting gradients for MTL. Specifically, we investigate layer-wise conflicting gradients, i.e., the task gradients w.r.t. each shared network layer. We first train the network with a regular MTL algorithm (e.g., joint-training) for a number of iterations, compute the conflict scores for all shared layers, and select those with highest conflict scores (indicating severe conflicts). We then set the selected shared layers task-specific and train the modified network from scratch. As demonstrated by comprehensive experiments and analysis, our simple approach Recon has the following key advantages: (1) Recon can greatly reduce conflicting gradients with only a slight increase in model parameters (less than 1% in some cases) and lead to significantly better performance.(2) Recon can be easily applied to improve various gradient manipulation methods and branched architecture search methods. Given a network architecture, it only needs to search for the conflict layers once, and the network can be modified to be used with different methods and even on different datasets to gain performance improvement.(3) Recon can achieve better performance than branched architecture search methods with a much smaller model.",,,
257102667,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 BOOSTING ADVERSARIAL TRANSFERABILITY USING DYNAMIC CUES,"The transferability of adversarial perturbations between image models has been extensively studied. In this case, an attack is generated from a known surrogate e.g., the ImageNet trained model, and transferred to change the decision of an unknown (black-box) model trained on an image dataset. However, attacks generated from image models do not capture the dynamic nature of a moving object or a changing scene due to a lack of temporal cues within image models. This leads to reduced transferability of adversarial attacks from representation-enriched image models such as Supervised Vision Transformers (ViTs), Self-supervised ViTs (e.g., DINO), and Vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to black-box video models. In this work, we induce dynamic cues within the image models without sacrificing their original performance on images. To this end, we optimize temporal prompts through frozen image models to capture motion dynamics. Our temporal prompts are the result of a learnable transformation that allows optimizing for temporal gradients during an adversarial attack to fool the motion dynamics. Specifically, we introduce spatial (image) and temporal (video) cues within the same source model through taskspecific prompts. Attacking such prompts maximizes the adversarial transferability from image-to-video and image-to-image models using the attacks designed for image models. As an example, an iterative attack launched from image model Deit-B with temporal prompts reduces generalization (top1 % accuracy) of a video model by 35% on Kinetics-400. Our approach also improves adversarial transferability to image models by 9% on ImageNet w.r.t the current state-of-the-art approach. Our attack results indicate that the attacker does not need specialized architectures, e.g., divided space-time attention, 3D convolutions, or multi-view convolution networks for different data modalities. Image models are effective surrogates to optimize an adversarial attack to fool black-box models in a changing environment over time.

However, the image models lack dynamic temporal cues which are essential for transfer to the video models.We are motivated by the fact that in a real-world setting, a scene is not static but mostly involves various dynamics, e.g., object motion, changing viewpoints, illumination and background changes. Therefore, exploiting dynamic cues within an adversarial attack is essential to find blind-spots of unknown target models. For this purpose, we introduce the idea of encoding disentangled temporal representations within an image-based Vision Transformer (ViT) model using dedicated temporal prompts while keeping the remaining network frozen. The temporal prompts can learn the dynamic cues which are exploited during attack for improved transferability from image-domain models. Specifically, we introduce the proposed temporal prompts to three types of image models with enriched representations acquired via supervised (ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020)), self-supervised (DINO (Caron et al., 2021)) or multi-modal learning (CLIP (Radford et al., 2021)).Our approach offers the benefit that the attacks do not need to rely on specialized networks designed for videos towards better adversarial transferability. As an example, popular model designs for videos incorporate 3D convolutions, space-time attention, tube embeddings or multi-view information to be robust against the temporal changes(Bertasius et al., 2021;Arnab et al., 2021). Without access to such specific design choices, our approach demonstrates how an attacker can leverage regular image models augmented with temporal prompts to learn dynamic cues. Further, our approach can be easily extended to image datasets, where disentangled representations can be learned via tokens across a scale-space at varying image resolutions. In summary, the major contributions of this work include:",,,

257232422,PARAMETRIZING PRODUCT SHAPE MANIFOLDS BY COMPOSITE NETWORKS,"Parametrizations of data manifolds in shape spaces can be computed using the rich toolbox of Riemannian geometry. This, however, often comes with high computational costs, which raises the question if one can learn an efficient neural network approximation. We show that this is indeed possible for shape spaces with a special product structure, namely those smoothly approximable by a direct sum of low-dimensional manifolds. Our proposed architecture leverages this structure by separately learning approximations for the low-dimensional factors and a subsequent combination. After developing the approach as a general framework, we apply it to a shape space of triangular surfaces. Here, typical examples of data manifolds are given through datasets of articulated models and can be factorized, for example, by a Sparse Principal Geodesic Analysis (SPGA).

However, how can self-supervised learning discover useful representations, and why is it better than traditional approaches such as probabilistic models are still largely unknown. In this paper, we focus on the context of topic modeling and highlight a key advantage of self-supervised learning -when applied to data generated by topic models, self-supervised learning can be oblivious to the specific model, and hence is less susceptible to model misspecification. In particular, we prove that commonly used self-supervised objectives based on reconstruction or contrastive samples can both recover useful posterior information for general topic models. Empirically, we show that the same objectives can perform on par with posterior inference using the correct model, while outperforming posterior inference using misspecified models. : Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.04805, 2018.Nicolas Gillis and StephenA Vavasis.

257254919,LS-IQ: IMPLICIT REWARD REGULARIZATION FOR INVERSE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING,"Recent methods for imitation learning directly learn a Q-function using an implicit reward formulation rather than an explicit reward function. However, these methods generally require implicit reward regularization to improve stability and often mistreat absorbing states. Previous works show that a squared norm regularization on the implicit reward function is effective, but do not provide a theoretical analysis of the resulting properties of the algorithms. In this work, we show that using this regularizer under a mixture distribution of the policy and the expert provides a particularly illuminating perspective: the original objective can be understood as squared Bellman error minimization, and the corresponding optimization problem minimizes a bounded χ 2 -Divergence between the expert and the mixture distribution. This perspective allows us to address instabilities and properly treat absorbing states. We show that our method, Least Squares Inverse Q-Learning (LS-IQ), outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly in environments with absorbing states. Finally, we propose to use an inverse dynamics model to learn from observations only. Using this approach, we retain performance in settings where no expert actions are available. 1",,,
257255149,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 INFORMATION PLANE ANALYSIS FOR DROPOUT NEURAL NETWORKS,"The information-theoretic framework promises to explain the predictive power of neural networks. In particular, the information plane analysis, which measures mutual information (MI) between input and representation as well as representation and output, should give rich insights into the training process. This approach, however, was shown to strongly depend on the choice of estimator of the MI. The problem is amplified for deterministic networks if the MI between input and representation is infinite. Thus, the estimated values are defined by the different approaches for estimation, but do not adequately represent the training process from an information-theoretic perspective. In this work, we show that dropout with continuously distributed noise ensures that MI is finite.

Our model is based on three new ideas. First, we incorporate an inaccurate off-the-shelf depth estimator into 3D GAN training via a special depth adaptation module to handle the imprecision. Then, we create a flexible camera model and a regularization strategy for it to learn its distribution parameters during training. Finally, we extend the recent ideas of transferring knowledge from pretrained classifiers into GANs for patch-wise trained models by employing a simple distillation-based technique on top of the discriminator. It achieves more stable training than the existing methods and speeds up the convergence by at least 40%. We explore our model on four datasets: SDIP Dogs 256 2 , SDIP Elephants 256 2 , LSUN Horses 256 2 , and ImageNet 256 2 and demonstrate that 3DGP outperforms the recent state-of-the-art in terms of both texture and geometry quality.Code and visualizations: https://snap-research.github.io/3dgp * Work done during internship at Snap Inc.",,,

2 Mar 2023

Shutong Wu 
Arizona State Univer","widely used in commercial acoustic systems in recent years.However, adversarial audio examples can cause abnormal behaviors for those acoustic systems, while being hard for humans to perceive.Various methods, such as transformation-based defenses and adversarial training, have been proposed to protect acoustic systems from adversarial attacks, but they are less effective against adaptive attacks.Furthermore, directly applying the methods from the image domain can lead to suboptimal results because of the unique properties of audio data.In this paper, we propose an adversarial purification-based defense pipeline, AudioPure, for acoustic systems via offthe-shelf diffusion models.Taking advantage of the strong generation ability of diffusion models, AudioPure first adds a small amount of noise to the adversarial audio and then runs the reverse sampling step to purify the noisy audio and recover clean audio.AudioPure is a plug-and-play method that can be directly applied to any pretrained classifier without any fine-tuning or re-training.We conduct extensive experiments on speech command recognition task to evaluate the robustness of AudioPure.Our method is effective against diverse adversarial attacks (e.g.L 2 or L ∞ -norm).It outperforms the existing methods under both strong adaptive white-box and black-box attacks bounded by L 2 or L ∞norm (up to +20% in robust accuracy).Besides, we also evaluate the certified robustness for perturbations bounded by L 2 -norm via randomized smoothing.Our pipeline achieves a higher certified accuracy than baselines.Code is available at https://github.com/cychomatica/AudioPure.

257427168,RETHINKING SELF-SUPERVISED VISUAL REPRESEN- TATION LEARNING IN PRE-TRAINING FOR 3D HUMAN POSE AND SHAPE ESTIMATION,"Recently, a few self-supervised representation learning (SSL) methods have outperformed the ImageNet classification pre-training for vision tasks such as object detection. However, its effects on 3D human body pose and shape estimation (3DHPSE) are open to question, whose target is fixed to a unique class, the human, and has an inherent task gap with SSL. We empirically study and analyze the effects of SSL and further compare it with other pre-training alternatives for 3DH-PSE. The alternatives are 2D annotation-based pre-training and synthetic data pretraining, which share the motivation of SSL that aims to reduce the labeling cost. They have been widely utilized as a source of weak-supervision or fine-tuning, but have not been remarked as a pre-training source. SSL methods underperform the conventional ImageNet classification pre-training on multiple 3DHPSE benchmarks by 7.7% on average. In contrast, despite a much less amount of pre-training data, the 2D annotation-based pre-training improves accuracy on all benchmarks and shows faster convergence during fine-tuning. Our observations challenge the naive application of the current SSL pre-training to 3DHPSE and relight the value of other data types in the pre-training aspect.",,,
257482853,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 EFFICIENT RECURRENT ARCHITECTURES THROUGH ACTIVITY SPARSITY AND SPARSE BACK-PROPAGATION THROUGH TIME,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are well suited for solving sequence tasks in resource-constrained systems due to their expressivity and low computational requirements. However, there is still a need to bridge the gap between what RNNs are capable of in terms of efficiency and performance and real-world application requirements. The memory and computational requirements arising from propagating the activations of all the neurons at every time step to every connected neuron, together with the sequential dependence of activations, contribute to the inefficiency of training and using RNNs. We propose a solution inspired by biological neuron dynamics that makes the communication between RNN units sparse and discrete. This makes the backward pass with backpropagation through time (BPTT) computationally sparse and efficient as well. We base our model on the gated recurrent unit (GRU), extending it with units that emit discrete events for communication triggered by a threshold so that no information is communicated to other units in the absence of events. We show theoretically that the communication between units, and hence the computation required for both the forward and backward passes, scales with the number of events in the network. Our model achieves efficiency without compromising task performance, demonstrating competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art recurrent network models in real-world tasks, including language modeling. The dynamic activity sparsity mechanism also makes our model well suited for novel energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware. Code is available at https://github.com/KhaleelKhan/EvNN/. computation on the previous time step's output prevents easy parallelisation of the model computation. Moreover, propagating the activations of all the units in each time step is computationally inefficient and leads to high memory requirements when training with backpropagation through time (BPTT).While allowing extraordinary task performance, the biological brain's recurrent architecture is extremely energy efficient (Mead, 2020). One of the brain's strategies to reach these high levels of efficiency is activity sparsity. In the brain, (asynchronous) event-based and activity-sparse communication results from the properties of the specific physical and biological substrate on which * Work done while at Ruhr University Bochum Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 the brain is built. Biologically realistic spiking neural networks and neuromorphic hardware aim to use these principles to build energy-efficient software and hardware models (Roy et al., 2019; Schuman  et al., 2017). However, despite progress in recent years, their task performance has been relatively limited for real-world tasks compared to recurrent architectures based on LSTM and GRU.In this work, we propose an activity sparsity mechanism inspired by biological neuron models, to reduce the computation required by RNNs at each time step. Our method adds a mechanism to the recurrent units to emit discrete events for communication triggered by a threshold so that no information is communicated to other units in the absence of events. With event-based communication, units in the model can decide when to send updates to other units, which then trigger the update of receiving units. When events are sent sparingly, this leads to activity-sparsity where most units do not send updates to other units most of the time, leading to substantial computational savings during training and inference. We formulate the gradient updates of the network to be sparse using a novel method, extending the benefit of the computational savings to training time. We theoretically show, in the continuous time limit, that the time complexity of calculating weight updates is proportional to the number of events in the network. We demonstrate these properties using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)(Cho et al., 2014)as a case study, and call our model Event-based Gated Recurrent Unit (EGRU). We note, however, that our dynamic activity-sparsity mechanism can be applied to any RNN architecture.In summary, the main contributions of this paper are the following:1. We introduce a variant of the GRU with an event-generating mechanism, called the EGRU.2. We theoretically show that, in the continuous time limit, both the forward pass computation and the computation of parameter updates in the EGRU scales with the number of events (active units).3. We demonstrate that the EGRU exhibits task-performance competitive with state-of-the-art recurrent network architectures on real-world machine learning benchmarks.4. We empirically show that EGRU exhibits high levels of activity-sparsity during both inference (forward pass) and learning (backward pass).We note here that methods for training with parameter sparsity or improving handling of long-term dependencies are both orthogonal to, and can be combined with our approach (which we plan to do in future work). Our focus, in this paper, is exclusively on using activity-sparsity to increase the efficiency of RNNs, specifically the GRU. We expect our method to be more efficient but not better at handling long-range dependencies compared to the GRU.The sparsity of the backward-pass overcomes one of the major roadblocks in using large recurrent models, which is having enough computational resources to train them. We demonstrate the task performance and activity sparsity of the model implemented in PyTorch, but this formulation will also allow the model to run efficiently on CPU-based nodes when implemented using appropriate software paradigms. Moreover, an implementation on novel neuromorphic hardware like Davies et al.  (2018); Höppner et al. (2017), that is geared towards event-based computation, can make the model orders of magnitude more energy efficient (Ostrau et al., 2022).",,,
257496457,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 SCHEMA INFERENCE FOR INTERPRETABLE IMAGE CLASSIFICATION,"In this paper, we study a novel inference paradigm, termed as schema inference, that learns to deductively infer the explainable predictions by rebuilding the prior deep neural network (DNN) forwarding scheme, guided by the prevalent philosophical cognitive concept of schema. We strive to reformulate the conventional model inference pipeline into a graph matching policy that associates the extracted visual concepts of an image with the pre-computed scene impression, by analogy with human reasoning mechanism via impression matching. To this end, we devise an elaborated architecture, termed as SchemaNet, as a dedicated instantiation of the proposed schema inference concept, that models both the visual semantics of input instances and the learned abstract imaginations of target categories as topological relational graphs. Meanwhile, to capture and leverage the compositional contributions of visual semantics in a global view, we also introduce a universal Feat2Graph scheme in SchemaNet to establish the relational graphs that contain abundant interaction information. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed schema inference achieves encouraging performance and meanwhile yields a clear picture of the deductive process leading to the predictions.

257632050,Memorization Capacity of Neural Networks with Conditional Computation,"Many empirical studies have demonstrated the performance benefits of conditional computation in neural networks, including reduced inference time and power consumption. We study the fundamental limits of neural conditional computation from the perspective of memorization capacity. For Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks without conditional computation, it is known that memorizing a collection of n input-output relationships can be accomplished via a neural network with O( √ n) neurons. Calculating the output of this neural network can be accomplished using O( √ n) elementary arithmetic operations of additions, multiplications and comparisons for each input. Using a conditional ReLU network, we show that the same task can be accomplished using only O(log n) operations per input. This represents an almost exponential improvement as compared to networks without conditional computation. We also show that the Θ(log n) rate is the best possible. Our achievability result utilizes a general methodology to synthesize a conditional network out of an unconditional network in a computationally-efficient manner, bridging the gap between unconditional and conditional architectures.",,,
257636556,Influencer Backdoor Attack on Semantic Segmentation,"When a small number of poisoned samples are injected into the training dataset of a deep neural network, the network can be induced to exhibit malicious behavior during inferences, which poses potential threats to real-world applications. While they have been intensively studied in classification, backdoor attacks on semantic segmentation have been largely overlooked. Unlike classification, semantic segmentation aims to classify every pixel within a given image. In this work, we explore backdoor attacks on segmentation models to misclassify all pixels of a victim class by injecting a specific trigger on non-victim pixels during inferences, which is dubbed Influencer Backdoor Attack (IBA). IBA is expected to maintain the classification accuracy of non-victim pixels and misleads classifications of all victim pixels in every single inference. Specifically, we consider two types of IBA scenarios, i.e., 1) Free-position IBA: the trigger can be positioned freely except for pixels of the victim class, and 2) Long-distance IBA: the trigger can only be positioned somewhere far from victim pixels, given the possible practical constraint. Based on the context aggregation ability of segmentation models, we propose techniques to improve IBA for the scenarios. Concretely, for free-position IBA, we propose a simple, yet effective Nearest Neighbor trigger injection strategy for poisoned sample creation. For long-distance IBA, we propose a novel Pixel Random Labeling strategy. Our extensive experiments reveal that current segmentation models do suffer from backdoor attacks, and verify that our proposed techniques can further increase attack performance.",,,
257687205,DRSM: DE-RANDOMIZED SMOOTHING ON MALWARE CLASSIFIER PROVIDING CERTIFIED ROBUSTNESS,"Machine Learning (ML) models have been utilized for malware detection for over two decades.Consequently, this ignited an ongoing arms race between malware authors and antivirus systems, compelling researchers to propose defenses for malware-detection models against evasion attacks.However, most if not all existing defenses against evasion attacks suffer from sizable performance degradation and/or can defend against only specific attacks, which makes them less practical in real-world settings.In this work, we develop a certified defense, DRSM (De-Randomized Smoothed MalConv), by redesigning the de-randomized smoothing technique for the domain of malware detection.Specifically, we propose a window ablation scheme to provably limit the impact of adversarial bytes while maximally preserving local structures of the executables.After showing how DRSM is theoretically robust against attacks with contiguous adversarial bytes, we verify its performance and certified robustness experimentally, where we observe only marginal accuracy drops as the cost of robustness.To our knowledge, we are the first to offer certified robustness in the realm of static detection of malware executables.More surprisingly, through evaluating DRSM against 9 empirical attacks of different types, we observe that the proposed defense is empirically robust to some extent against a diverse set of attacks, some of which even fall out of the scope of its original threat model.In addition, we collected 15.5K recent benign raw executables from diverse sources, which will be made public as a dataset called PACE (Publicly Accessible Collection(s) of Executables) to alleviate the scarcity of publicly available benign datasets for studying malware detection and provide future research with more representative data of the time.",,,
257757426,OPTIMAL TRANSPORT FOR OFFLINE IMITATION LEARNING,"With the advent of large datasets, offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising framework for learning good decision-making policies without the need to interact with the real environment. However, offline RL requires the dataset to be reward-annotated, which presents practical challenges when reward engineering is difficult or when obtaining reward annotations is labor-intensive. In this paper, we introduce Optimal Transport Reward labeling (OTR), an algorithm that assigns rewards to offline trajectories, with a few high-quality demonstrations. OTR's key idea is to use optimal transport to compute an optimal alignment between an unlabeled trajectory in the dataset and an expert demonstration to obtain a similarity measure that can be interpreted as a reward, which can then be used by an offline RL algorithm to learn the policy. OTR is easy to implement and computationally efficient. On D4RL benchmarks, we show that OTR with a single demonstration can consistently match the performance of offline RL with ground-truth rewards 1 .",,,
257766959,Seer: Language Instructed Video Prediction with Latent Diffusion Models,"Imagining the future trajectory is the key for robots to make sound planning and successfully reach their goals. Therefore, text-conditioned video prediction (TVP) is an essential task to facilitate general robot policy learning, i.e., predicting future video frames with a given language instruction and reference frames. It is a highly challenging task to ground task-level goals specified by instructions and high-fidelity frames together, requiring large-scale data and computation. To tackle this task and empower robots with the ability to foresee the future, we propose a sample and computation-efficient model, named Seer, by inflating the pretrained text-to-image (T2I) stable diffusion models along the temporal axis. We inflate the denoising U-Net and language conditioning model with two novel techniques, Autoregressive Spatial-Temporal Attention and Frame Sequential Text Decomposer, to propagate the rich prior knowledge in the pretrained T2I models across the frames. With the well-designed architecture, Seer makes it possible to generate high-fidelity, coherent, and instruction-aligned video frames by fine-tuning a few layers on a small amount of data. The experimental results on Something Something V2 (SSv2) and Bridgedata datasets demonstrate our superior video prediction performance with around 210-hour training on 4 RTX 3090 GPUs: decreasing the FVD of the current SOTA model from 290 to 200 on SSv2 and achieving at least 70% preference in the human evaluation. https://seervideodiffusion.github.io/",,,

257833684,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 SOFT NEIGHBORS ARE POSITIVE SUPPORTERS IN CONTRASTIVE VISUAL REPRESENTATION LEARNING,"Contrastive learning methods train visual encoders by comparing views (e.g., often created via a group of data augmentations on the same instance) from one instance to others. Typically, the views created from one instance are set as positive, while views from other instances are negative. This binary instance discrimination is studied extensively to improve feature representations in self-supervised learning. In this paper, we rethink the instance discrimination framework and find the binary instance labeling insufficient to measure correlations between different samples. For an intuitive example, given a random image instance, there may exist other images in a mini-batch whose content meanings are the same (i.e., belonging to the same category) or partially related (i.e., belonging to a similar category). How to treat the images that correlate similarly to the current image instance leaves an unexplored problem. We thus propose to support the current image by exploring other correlated instances (i.e., soft neighbors). We first carefully cultivate a candidate neighbor set, which will be further utilized to explore the highly-correlated instances. A cross-attention module is then introduced to predict the correlation score (denoted as positiveness) of other correlated instances with respect to the current one. The positiveness score quantitatively measures the positive support from each correlated instance, and is encoded into the objective for pretext training. To this end, our proposed method benefits in discriminating uncorrelated instances while absorbing correlated instances for SSL. We evaluate our soft neighbor contrastive learning method (SNCLR) on standard visual recognition benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. The state-of-theart recognition performance shows that SNCLR is effective in improving feature representations from both ViT and CNN encoders. * Corresponding author.

Previous results often focus on representation power. For example, Safran et al. (2019) constructed a function that is easy to approximate using a 3-layer network but not approximable by any 2-layer network. In this paper, we show that this separation is in fact algorithmic: one can learn the function constructed by Safran et al.(2019)using an overparameterized network with polynomially many neurons efficiently. Our result relies on a new way of extending the mean-field limit to multilayer networks, and a decomposition of loss that factors out the error introduced by the discretization of infinite-width mean-field networks.",,,
258041281,SparseFormer: Sparse Visual Recognition via Limited Latent Tokens,"Human visual recognition is a sparse process, where only a few salient visual cues are attended to rather than traversing every detail uniformly.However, most current vision networks follow a dense paradigm, processing every single visual unit (e.g., pixel or patch) in a uniform manner.In this paper, we challenge this dense paradigm and present a new method, coined SparseFormer, to imitate human's sparse visual recognition in an end-to-end manner.Sparse-Former learns to represent images using a highly limited number of tokens (down to 49) in the latent space with sparse feature sampling procedure instead of processing dense units in the original pixel space.Therefore, Sparse-Former circumvents most of dense operations on the image space and has much lower computational costs.Experiments on the ImageNet classification benchmark dataset show that SparseFormer achieves performance on par with canonical or well-established models while offering better accuracy-throughput tradeoff.Moreover, the design of our network can be easily extended to the video classification with promising performance at lower computational costs.We hope that our work can provide an alternative way for visual modeling and inspire further research on sparse neural architectures.The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/showlab/sparseformer.",,,

While prior work on robotic manipulation has predominantly used frozen pretrained features, we demonstrate that in robotics this approach can fail to reach optimal performance, and that fine-tuning of the full model can lead to significantly better results. Unfortunately, fine-tuning disrupts the pretrained visual representation, and causes representational drift towards the fine-tuned task thus leading to a loss of the versatility of the original model. We introduce lossless adaptation to address this shortcoming of classical fine-tuning. We demonstrate that appropriate placement of our parameter efficient adapters can significantly reduce the performance gap between frozen pretrained representations and full end-to-end finetuning without changes to the original representation and thus preserving original capabilities of the pretrained model. We perform a comprehensive investigation across three major model architectures (ViTs, NFNets, and ResNets), supervised (ImageNet-1K classification) and self-supervised pretrained weights (CLIP, BYOL, Visual MAE) in 3 task domains and 35 individual tasks, and demonstrate that our claims are strongly validated in various settings.

258179794,Context-Dependent Embedding Utterance Representations for Emotion Recognition in Conversations,"Emotion Recognition in Conversations(ERC)has been gaining increasing importance as conversational agents become more and more common. Recognizing emotions is key for effective communication, being a crucial component in the development of effective and empathetic conversational agents. Knowledge and understanding of the conversational context are extremely valuable for identifying the emotions of the interlocutor. We thus approach Emotion Recognition in Conversations leveraging the conversational context, i.e., taking into attention previous conversational turns. The usual approach to model the conversational context has been to produce context-independent representations of each utterance and subsequently perform contextual modeling of these. Here we propose context-dependent embedding representations of each utterance by leveraging the contextual representational power of pretrained transformer language models. In our approach, we feed the conversational context appended to the utterance to be classified as input to the RoBERTa encoder, to which we append a simple classification module, thus discarding the need to deal with context after obtaining the embeddings since these constitute already an efficient representation of such context. We also investigate how the number of introduced conversational turns influences our model performance. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on the open-domain DailyDialog dataset and on the task-oriented EmoWOZ dataset.",,,

258212748,MARTINGALE POSTERIOR NEURAL PROCESSES,"A Neural Process (NP) estimates a stochastic process implicitly defined with neural networks given a stream of data, rather than pre-specifying priors already known, such as Gaussian processes. An ideal NP would learn everything from data without any inductive biases, but in practice, we often restrict the class of stochastic processes for the ease of estimation. One such restriction is the use of a finite-dimensional latent variable accounting for the uncertainty in the functions drawn from NPs. Some recent works show that this can be improved with more ""data-driven"" source of uncertainty such as bootstrapping. In this work, we take a different approach based on the martingale posterior, a recently developed alternative to Bayesian inference. For the martingale posterior, instead of specifying prior-likelihood pairs, a predictive distribution for future data is specified. Under specific conditions on the predictive distribution, it can be shown that the uncertainty in the generated future data actually corresponds to the uncertainty of the implicitly defined Bayesian posteriors. Based on this result, instead of assuming any form of the latent variables, we equip a NP with a predictive distribution implicitly defined with neural networks and use the corresponding martingale posteriors as the source of uncertainty. The resulting model, which we name as Martingale Posterior Neural Process (MPNP), is demonstrated to outperform baselines on various tasks.",,,

However, these AI systems mainly focus on how to compete with humans, less on exploring how to collaborate with humans. To this end, this paper makes the first attempt to investigate human-agent collaboration in MOBA games. In this paper, we propose to enable humans and agents to collaborate through explicit communication by designing an efficient and interpretable Meta-Command Communication-based framework, dubbed MCC, for accomplishing effective human-agent collaboration in MOBA games. The MCC framework consists of two pivotal modules: 1) an interpretable communication protocol, i.e., the Meta-Command, to bridge the communication gap between humans and agents; 2) a meta-command value estimator, i.e., the Meta-Command Selector, to select a valuable meta-command for each agent to achieve effective human-agent collaboration. Experimental results in Honor of Kings demonstrate that MCC agents can collaborate reasonably well with human teammates and even generalize to collaborate with different levels and numbers of human teammates.

258298544,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 MOVING FORWARD BY MOVING BACKWARD: EMBED- DING ACTION IMPACT OVER ACTION SEMANTICS/projects/action-adaptive-policy,"A common assumption when training embodied agents is that the impact of taking an action is stable; for instance, executing the ""move ahead"" action will always move the agent forward by a fixed distance, perhaps with some small amount of actuator-induced noise. This assumption is limiting; an agent may encounter settings that dramatically alter the impact of actions: a move ahead action on a wet floor may send the agent twice as far as it expects and using the same action with a broken wheel might transform the expected translation into a rotation. Instead of relying that the impact of an action stably reflects its pre-defined semantic meaning, we propose to model the impact of actions on-the-fly using latent embeddings. By combining these latent action embeddings with a novel, transformerbased, policy head, we design an Action Adaptive Policy (AAP). We evaluate our AAP on two challenging visual navigation tasks in the AI2-THOR and Habitat environments and show that our AAP is highly performant even when faced, at inference-time with missing actions and, previously unseen, perturbed action space. Moreover, we observe significant improvement in robustness against these actions when evaluating in real-world scenarios.

These phenomena require a representation scheme at the morphology level and enhanced evaluation methods. In this paper, we propose a representation & evaluation scheme to incorporate dropped pronouns into coreference resolution and validate it on the Turkish language. Using the scheme, we extend the annotations on the only existing Turkish coreference dataset, which originally did not contain annotations for dropped pronouns. We provide publicly available pre and post processors to enhance the prominent CoNLL coreference scorer also to cover coreferential relations arising from dropped pronouns. As a final step, the paper reports the first neural Turkish coreference resolution results in the literature.

Knowledge distillation has been shown to be a practical solution to reduce inference costs, but the distillation process itself requires significant computational resources. Rather than buying or renting GPUs to fine-tune, then distill a large model, an NLP practitioner might instead choose to allocate the available budget to hire annotators and manually label additional fine-tuning data. In this paper, we investigate how to most efficiently use a fixed budget to build a compact model. Through extensive experiments on six diverse tasks, we show that distilling from T5-XXL (11B) to T5-Small (60M) is almost always a cost-efficient strategy compared to annotating more data to directly train a compact model (T5-Small). We further investigate how the optimal budget allocated towards computation varies across scenarios.

To address this challenge, we propose Differentially Private In-context Learning (DP-ICL), a general paradigm for privatizing ICL tasks. The key idea for DP-ICL paradigm is generating differentially private responses through a noisy consensus among an ensemble of LLM's responses based on disjoint exemplar sets. Based on the general paradigm of DP-ICL, we instantiate several techniques showing how to privatize ICL for text classification and language generation. We evaluate DP-ICL on four text classification benchmarks and two language generation tasks, and our empirical results show that DP-ICL achieves a strong utility-privacy tradeoff.",,,
258461036,Vision Meets Definitions: Unsupervised Visual Word Sense Disambiguation Incorporating Gloss Information,"Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) is a task to find the image that most accurately depicts the correct sense of the target word for the given context. Previously, image-text matching models often suffered from recognizing polysemous words. This paper introduces an unsupervised VWSD approach that uses gloss information of an external lexical knowledge-base, especially the sense definitions. Specifically, we suggest employing Bayesian inference to incorporate the sense definitions when sense information of the answer is not provided. In addition, to ameliorate the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue, we propose a context-aware definition generation with GPT-3. Experimental results show that VWSD performance increased significantly with our Bayesian inference-based approach. In addition, our context-aware definition generation achieved prominent performance improvement in OOV examples exhibiting better performance than the existing definition generation method.",,,
258461053,Post-Abstention: Towards Reliably Re-Attempting the Abstained Instances in QA,"Despite remarkable progress made in natural language processing, even the state-of-the-art models often make incorrect predictions. Such predictions hamper the reliability of systems and limit their widespread adoption in realworld applications. Selective prediction partly addresses the above concern by enabling models to abstain from answering when their predictions are likely to be incorrect. While selective prediction is advantageous, it leaves us with a pertinent question 'what to do after abstention'. To this end, we present an explorative study on 'Post-Abstention', a task that allows re-attempting the abstained instances with the aim of increasing coverage of the system without significantly sacrificing its accuracy. We first provide mathematical formulation of this task and then explore several methods to solve it. Comprehensive experiments on 11 QA datasets show that these methods lead to considerable risk improvements -performance metric of the Post-Abstention task-both in the in-domain and the out-of-domain settings. We also conduct a thorough analysis of these results which further leads to several interesting findings. Finally, we believe that our work will encourage and facilitate further research in this important area of addressing the reliability of NLP systems.",,,
258461287,Can Large Language Models Be an Alternative to Human Evaluation?,"Human evaluation is indispensable and inevitable for assessing the quality of texts generated by machine learning models or written by humans. However, human evaluation is very difficult to reproduce and its quality is notoriously unstable, hindering fair comparisons among different natural language processing (NLP) models and algorithms. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on unseen tasks when only the task instructions are provided. In this paper, we explore if such an ability of the LLMs can be used as an alternative to human evaluation. We present the LLMs with the exact same instructions, samples to be evaluated, and questions used to conduct human evaluation, and then ask the LLMs to generate responses to those questions; we dub this LLM evaluation. We use human evaluation and LLM evaluation to evaluate the texts in two NLP tasks: openended story generation and adversarial attacks. We show that the result of LLM evaluation is consistent with the results obtained by expert human evaluation: the texts rated higher by human experts are also rated higher by the LLMs. We also find that the results of LLM evaluation are stable over different formatting of the task instructions and the sampling algorithm used to generate the answer. We are the first to show the potential of using LLMs to assess the quality of texts and discuss the limitations and ethical considerations of LLM evaluation. , et al. 2020.

258461336,A Systematic Study of Knowledge Distillation for Natural Language Generation with Pseudo-Target Training,"Modern Natural Language Generation (NLG) models come with massive computational and storage requirements. In this work, we study the potential of compressing them, which is crucial for real-world applications serving millions of users. We focus on Knowledge Distillation (KD) techniques, in which a small student model learns to imitate a large teacher model, allowing to transfer knowledge from the teacher to the student. In contrast to much of the previous work, our goal is to optimize the model for a specific NLG task and a specific dataset. Typically in real-world applications, in addition to labeled data there is abundant unlabeled task-specific data, which is crucial for attaining high compression rates via KD. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of task-specific KD techniques for various NLG tasks under realistic assumptions. We discuss the special characteristics of NLG distillation and particularly the exposure bias problem. Following, we derive a family of Pseudo-Target (PT) augmentation methods, substantially extending prior work on sequence-level KD. We propose the Joint-Teaching method, which applies wordlevel KD to multiple PTs generated by both the teacher and the student. Finally, we validate our findings in an extreme setup with no labeled examples using GPT-4 as the teacher.Our study provides practical model design observations and demonstrates the effectiveness of PT training for task-specific KD in NLG.",,,
258480011,ZipIt! Merging Models from Different Tasks without Training,"Typical deep visual recognition models are capable of performing the one task they were trained on. In this paper, we tackle the extremely difficult problem of combining completely distinct models with different initializations, each solving a separate task, into one multi-task model without any additional training. Prior work in model merging permutes one model to the space of the other then adds them together. While this works for models trained on the same task, we find that this fails to account for the differences in models trained on disjoint tasks. Thus, we introduce ""ZipIt!"", a general method for merging two arbitrary models of the same architecture that incorporates two simple strategies. First, in order to account for features that aren't shared between models, we expand the model merging problem to additionally allow for merging features within each model by defining a general ""zip"" operation. Second, we add support for partially zipping the models up until a specified layer, naturally creating a multi-head model. We find that these two changes combined account for a staggering 20-60% improvement over prior work, making the merging of models trained on disjoint tasks feasible.",,,

258546855,White-Box Multi-Objective Adversarial Attack on Dialogue Generation,"Pre-trained transformers are popular in stateof-the-art dialogue generation (DG) systems. Such language models are, however, vulnerable to various adversarial samples as studied in traditional tasks such as text classification, which inspires our curiosity about their robustness in DG systems. One main challenge of attacking DG models is that perturbations on the current sentence can hardly degrade the response accuracy because the unchanged chat histories are also considered for decision-making. Instead of merely pursuing pitfalls of performance metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, we observe that crafting adversarial samples to force longer generation outputs benefits attack effectiveness-the generated responses are typically irrelevant, lengthy, and repetitive. To this end, we propose a white-box multi-objective attack method called DGSlow. Specifically, DGSlow balances two objectives-generation accuracy and length, via a gradient-based multiobjective optimizer and applies an adaptive searching mechanism to iteratively craft adversarial samples with only a few modifications. Comprehensive experiments 1 on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DGSlow could significantly degrade state-of-the-art DG models with a higher success rate than traditional accuracy-based methods. Besides, our crafted sentences also exhibit strong transferability in attacking other models.",,,
258546861,Chain-of-Skills: A Configurable Model for Open-Domain Question Answering,"The retrieval model is an indispensable component for real-world knowledge-intensive tasks, e.g., open-domain question answering (ODQA). As separate retrieval skills are annotated for different datasets, recent work focuses on customized methods, limiting the model transferability and scalability. In this work, we propose a modular retriever where individual modules correspond to key skills that can be reused across datasets. Our approach supports flexible skill configurations based on the target domain to boost performance. To mitigate task interference, we design a novel modularization parameterization inspired by sparse Transformer. We demonstrate that our model can benefit from self-supervised pretraining on Wikipedia and fine-tuning using multiple ODQA datasets, both in a multi-task fashion. Our approach outperforms recent self-supervised retrievers in zero-shot evaluations and achieves state-ofthe-art fine-tuned retrieval performance on NQ, HotpotQA and OTT-QA.",,,
258546862,Are Human Explanations Always Helpful? Towards Objective Evaluation of Human Natural Language Explanations,"Human-annotated labels and explanations are critical for training explainable NLP models. However, unlike human-annotated labels whose quality is easier to calibrate (e.g., with a majority vote), human-crafted free-form explanations can be quite subjective. Before blindly using them as ground truth to train ML models, a vital question needs to be asked: How do we evaluate a human-annotated explanation's quality? In this paper, we build on the view that the quality of a human-annotated explanation can be measured based on its helpfulness (or impairment) to the ML models' performance for the desired NLP tasks for which the annotations were collected. In comparison to the commonly used Simulatability score, we define a new metric that can take into consideration of the helpfulness of an explanation for model performance at both fine-tuning and inference. With the help of a unified dataset format, we evaluated the proposed metric on five datasets (e.g., e-SNLI) against two model architectures (T5 and BART), and the results show that our proposed metric can objectively evaluate the quality of human-annotated explanations, while Simulatability falls short.",,,
258547050,Modeling What-to-ask and How-to-ask for Answer-unaware Conversational Question Generation,"Conversational Question Generation (CQG) is a critical task for machines to assist humans in fulfilling their information needs through conversations. The task is generally cast into two different settings: answer-aware and answerunaware. While the former facilitates the models by exposing the expected answer, the latter is more realistic and receiving growing attentions recently. What-to-ask and how-to-ask are the two main challenges in the answerunaware setting. To address the first challenge, existing methods mainly select sequential sentences in context as the rationales. We argue that the conversation generated using such naive heuristics may not be natural enough as in reality, the interlocutors often talk about the relevant contents that are not necessarily sequential in context. Additionally, previous methods decide the type of question (boolean/span-based) to be generated implicitly. Modeling the question type explicitly is crucial in this (answer-unaware) setting, as the answer which hints the models to generate a boolean or span-based question, is unavailable. To this end, we present SG-CQG, a two-stage CQG framework. For the what-to-ask stage, a sentence is selected as the rationale from a semantic graph that we construct, and extract the answer span from it. For the how-to-ask stage, a classifier determines the target answer type of the question via two explicit control signals before generating and filtering. In addition, we propose Conv-Distinct, a novel evaluation metric for CQG, to evaluate the diversity of the generated conversation from a context. Compared with the existing answer-unaware CQG models, the proposed SG-CQG achieves stateof-the-art performance.",,,

To search for those significant attention heads, we develop a novel framework to analyze the effectiveness of heads. Specifically, we first model the relationship between heads into a graph from two perspectives of information richness and correlation, and then apply PageRank algorithm to determine the relative importance of each head. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and show that HiFi obtains state-of-the-art performance over the prior baselines. * Corresponding author.

258557145,CAT: A Contextualized Conceptualization and Instantiation Framework for Commonsense Reasoning,"Commonsense reasoning, aiming at endowing machines with a human-like ability to make situational presumptions, is extremely challenging to generalize. For someone who barely knows about meditation, while is knowledgeable about singing, he can still infer that meditation makes people relaxed from the existing knowledge that singing makes people relaxed by first conceptualizing singing as a relaxing event and then instantiating that event to meditation. This process, known as conceptual induction and deduction, is fundamental to commonsense reasoning while lacking both labeled data and methodologies to enhance commonsense modeling. To fill such a research gap, we propose CAT (Contextualized ConceptuAlization and InsTantiation), a semi-supervised learning framework that integrates event conceptualization and instantiation to conceptualize commonsense knowledge bases at scale. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performances on two conceptualization tasks, and the acquired abstract commonsense knowledge can significantly improve commonsense inference modeling.

Utilizing this comment as guidance, our fault-aware code editor is employed to correct errors in the generated code.

Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the Hu-manEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are ""Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning"". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans.

To address this gap, we introduce the MultiTACRED dataset, covering 12 typologically diverse languages from 9 language families, which is created by machine-translating TACRED instances and automatically projecting their entity annotations. We analyze translation and annotation projection quality, identify error categories, and experimentally evaluate fine-tuned pretrained mono-and multilingual language models in common transfer learning scenarios. Our analyses show that machine translation is a viable strategy to transfer RE instances, with native speakers judging more than 83% of the translated instances to be linguistically and semantically acceptable. We find monolingual RE model performance to be comparable to the English original for many of the target languages, and that multilingual models trained on a combination of English and target language data can outperform their monolingual counterparts. However, we also observe a variety of translation and annotation projection errors, both due to the MT systems and linguistic features of the target languages, such as pronoun-dropping, compounding and inflection, that degrade dataset quality and RE model performance.",,,
258557751,Unified Demonstration Retriever for In-Context Learning,"In-context learning is a new learning paradigm where a language model conditions on a few input-output pairs (demonstrations) and a test input, and directly outputs the prediction. It has been shown highly dependent on the provided demonstrations and thus promotes the research of demonstration retrieval: given a test input, relevant examples are retrieved from the training set to serve as informative demonstrations for in-context learning. While previous works focus on training task-specific retrievers for several tasks separately, these methods are often hard to transfer and scale on various tasks, and separately trained retrievers incur a lot of parameter storage and deployment cost. In this paper, we propose Unified Demonstration Retriever (UDR), a single model to retrieve demonstrations for a wide range of tasks. To train UDR, we cast various tasks' training signals into a unified list-wise ranking formulation by language model's feedback. Then we propose a multi-task list-wise ranking training framework, with an iterative mining strategy to find high-quality candidates, which can help UDR fully incorporate various tasks' signals. Experiments on 30+ tasks across 13 task families and multiple data domains show that UDR significantly outperforms baselines.

258588286,Multilingual LLMs are Better Cross-lingual In-context Learners with Alignment,"In-context learning (ICL) unfolds as large language models become capable of inferring test labels conditioned on a few labeled samples without any gradient update. ICL-enabled large language models provide a promising step forward toward bypassing recurrent annotation costs in a low-resource setting. Yet, only a handful of past studies have explored ICL in a cross-lingual setting, in which the need for transferring label-knowledge from a high-resource language to a low-resource one is immensely crucial. To bridge the gap, we provide the first in-depth analysis of ICL for cross-lingual text classification. We find that the prevalent mode of selecting random inputlabel pairs to construct the prompt-context is severely limited in the case of cross-lingual ICL, primarily due to the lack of alignment in the input as well as the output spaces. To mitigate this, we propose a novel prompt construction strategy -Cross-lingual In-context Source-Target Alignment (X-InSTA). With an injected coherence in the semantics of the input examples and a task-based alignment across the source and target languages, X-InSTA is able to outperform random prompt selection by a large margin across three different tasks using 44 different cross-lingual pairs.",,,
258588364,Alleviating Over-smoothing for Unsupervised Sentence Representation,"Currently, learning better unsupervised sentence representations is the pursuit of many natural language processing communities. Lots of approaches based on pre-trained language models (PLMs) and contrastive learning have achieved promising results on this task. Experimentally, we observe that the over-smoothing problem reduces the capacity of these powerful PLMs, leading to suboptimal sentence representations. In this paper, we present a Simple method named Self-Contrastive Learning (SSCL) to alleviate this issue, which samples negatives from PLMs intermediate layers, improving the quality of the sentence representation. Our proposed method is quite simple and can be easily extended to various state-of-the-art models for performance boosting, which can be seen as a plugand-play contrastive framework for learning unsupervised sentence representation.

258615193,Evaluating Open-Domain Question Answering in the Era of Large Language Models,"Lexical matching remains the de facto evaluation method for open-domain question answering (QA). Unfortunately, lexical matching fails completely when a plausible candidate answer does not appear in the list of gold answers, which is increasingly the case as we shift from extractive to generative models. The recent success of large language models (LLMs) for QA aggravates lexical matching failures since candidate answers become longer, thereby making matching with the gold answers even more challenging. Without accurate evaluation, the true progress in open-domain QA remains unknown. In this paper, we conduct a thorough analysis of various open-domain QA models, including LLMs, by manually evaluating their answers on a subset of NQ-OPEN, a popular benchmark. Our assessments reveal that while the true performance of all models is significantly underestimated, the performance of the InstructGPT (zero-shot) LLM increases by nearly +60%, making it on par with existing top models, and the InstructGPT (few-shot) model actually achieves a new state-of-the-art on NQ-OPEN. We also find that more than 50% of lexical matching failures are attributed to semantically equivalent answers. We further demonstrate that regex matching ranks QA models consistent with human judgments, although still suffering from unnecessary strictness. Finally, we demonstrate that automated evaluation models are a reasonable surrogate for lexical matching in some circumstances, but not for long-form answers generated by LLMs. The automated models struggle in detecting hallucinations in LLM answers and are thus unable to evaluate LLMs. At this time, there appears to be no substitute for human evaluation.",,,
258685538,Learning to Simulate Natural Language Feedback for Interactive Semantic Parsing,"Interactive semantic parsing based on natural language (NL) feedback, where users provide feedback to correct the parser mistakes, has emerged as a more practical scenario than the traditional one-shot semantic parsing. However, prior work has heavily relied on humanannotated feedback data to train the interactive semantic parser, which is prohibitively expensive and not scalable. In this work, we propose a new task of simulating NL feedback for interactive semantic parsing. We accompany the task with a novel feedback evaluator. The evaluator is specifically designed to assess the quality of the simulated feedback, based on which we decide the best feedback simulator from our proposed variants. On a text-to-SQL dataset, we show that our feedback simulator can generate high-quality NL feedback to boost the error correction ability of a specific parser. In low-data settings, our feedback simulator can help achieve comparable error correction performance as trained using the costly, full set of human annotations. 1",,,

258714602,Bidirectional Generative Framework for Cross-domain Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Cross-domain aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to perform various fine-grained sentiment analysis tasks on a target domain by transferring knowledge from a source domain. Since labeled data only exists in the source domain, a model is expected to bridge the domain gap for tackling cross-domain ABSA. Though domain adaptation methods have proven to be effective, most of them are based on a discriminative model, which needs to be specifically designed for different ABSA tasks. To offer a more general solution, we propose a unified bidirectional generative framework to tackle various cross-domain ABSA tasks. Specifically, our framework trains a generative model in both text-to-label and label-to-text directions. The former transforms each task into a unified format to learn domain-agnostic features, and the latter generates natural sentences from noisy labels for data augmentation, with which a more accurate model can be trained. To investigate the effectiveness and generality of our framework, we conduct extensive experiments on four cross-domain ABSA tasks and present new state-of-the-art results on all tasks.

258715048,Pre-Training to Learn in Context,"In-context learning, where pre-trained language models learn to perform tasks from task examples and instructions in their contexts, has attracted much attention in the NLP community. However, the ability of in-context learning is not fully exploited because language models are not explicitly trained to learn in context. To this end, we propose PICL (Pretraining for In-Context Learning), a framework to enhance the language models' in-context learning ability by pre-training the model on a large collection of ""intrinsic tasks"" in the general plain-text corpus using the simple language modeling objective. PICL encourages the model to infer and perform tasks by conditioning on the contexts while maintaining task generalization of pre-trained models. We evaluate the in-context learning performance of the model trained with PICL on seven widelyused text classification datasets and the SUPER-NATURALINSTRCTIONS benchmark, which contains 100+ NLP tasks formulated to text generation. Our experiments show that PICL is more effective and task-generalizable than a range of baselines, outperforming larger language models with nearly 4x parameters.

258715255,Dual-Alignment Pre-training for Cross-lingual Sentence Embedding,"Recent studies have shown that dual encoder models trained with the sentence-level translation ranking task are effective methods for cross-lingual sentence embedding. However, our research indicates that token-level alignment is also crucial in multilingual scenarios, which has not been fully explored previously. Based on our findings, we propose a dual-alignment pre-training (DAP) framework for cross-lingual sentence embedding that incorporates both sentence-level and token-level alignment. To achieve this, we introduce a novel representation translation learning (RTL) task, where the model learns to use one-side contextualized token representation to reconstruct its translation counterpart. This reconstruction objective encourages the model to embed translation information into the token representation. Compared to other token-level alignment methods such as translation language modeling, RTL is more suitable for dual encoder architectures and is computationally efficient. Extensive experiments on three sentencelevel cross-lingual benchmarks demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve sentence embedding.

This leads to a natural problem of situated and fine-grained personality understanding. The problem has not been studied in the NLP field, primarily due to the lack of appropriate datasets mimicking the process of book reading. We present the first labeled dataset PERSONET for this problem. Our novel annotation strategy involves annotating user notes from online reading apps as a proxy for the original books.

258762633,TOME: A Two-stage Approach for Model-based Retrieval,"Recently, model-based retrieval has emerged as a new paradigm in text retrieval that discards the index in the traditional retrieval model and instead memorizes the candidate corpora using model parameters. This design employs a sequence-to-sequence paradigm to generate document identifiers, which enables the complete capture of the relevance between queries and documents and simplifies the classic indexretrieval-rerank pipeline. Despite its attractive qualities, there remain several major challenges in model-based retrieval, including the discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning, and the discrepancy between training and inference. To deal with the above challenges, we propose a novel two-stage model-based retrieval approach called TOME, which makes two major technical contributions, including the utilization of tokenized URLs as identifiers and the design of a two-stage generation architecture. We also propose a number of training strategies to deal with the training difficulty as the corpus size increases. Extensive experiments and analysis on MS MARCO and Natural Questions demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, and we investigate the scaling laws of TOME by examining various influencing factors.",,,
258822815,QUEST: A Retrieval Dataset of Entity-Seeking Queries with Implicit Set Operations,"Formulating selective information needs results in queries that implicitly specify set operations, such as intersection, union, and difference. For instance, one might search for ""shorebirds that are not sandpipers"" or ""science-fiction films shot in England"". To study the ability of retrieval systems to meet such information needs, we construct QUEST, a dataset of 3357 natural language queries with implicit set operations, that map to a set of entities corresponding to Wikipedia documents. The dataset challenges models to match multiple constraints mentioned in queries with corresponding evidence in documents and correctly perform various set operations. The dataset is constructed semi-automatically using Wikipedia category names. Queries are automatically composed from individual categories, then paraphrased and further validated for naturalness and fluency by crowdworkers. Crowdworkers also assess the relevance of entities based on their documents and highlight attribution of query constraints to spans of document text. We analyze several modern retrieval systems, finding that they often struggle on such queries.

We instead scale LLMs horizontally: we create, through continued pretraining, Glot500-m, an LLM that covers 511 predominantly low-resource languages. An important part of this effort is to collect and clean Glot500-c, a corpus that covers these 511 languages and allows us to train Glot500-m. We evaluate Glot500-m on five diverse tasks across these languages. We observe large improvements for both high-resource and low-resource languages compared to an XLM-R baseline. Our analysis shows that no single factor explains the quality of multilingual LLM representations. Rather, a combination of factors determines quality including corpus size, script, ""help"" from related languages and the total capacity of the model. Our work addresses an important goal of NLP research: we should not limit NLP to a small fraction of the world's languages and instead strive to support as many languages as possible to bring the benefits of NLP technology to all languages and cultures.

258832501,Enhancing Small Medical Learners with Privacy-preserving Contextual Prompting,"Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable medical expertise, but data privacy concerns impede their direct use in healthcare environments. Although offering improved data privacy protection, domain-specific small language models (SLMs) often underperform LLMs, emphasizing the need for methods that reduce this performance gap while alleviating privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method that harnesses LLMs' medical proficiency to boost SLM performance in medical tasks under privacy-restricted scenarios. Specifically, we mitigate patient privacy issues by extracting keywords from medical data and prompting the LLM to generate a medical knowledge-intensive context by simulating clinicians' thought processes. This context serves as additional input for SLMs, augmenting their decision-making capabilities. Our method significantly enhances performance in both few-shot and full training settings across three medical knowledge-intensive tasks, achieving up to a 22.57% increase in absolute accuracy compared to SLM fine-tuning without context, and sets new state-ofthe-art results in two medical tasks within privacy-restricted scenarios. Further out-of-domain testing and experiments in two general domain datasets showcase its generalizability and broad applicability.Figure 1: Synthetic medical data for illustration. Though rich in domain-specific knowledge, medical data contains sensitive private information. We extract keywords to mitigate privacy concerns.Steven Smith is a 60-year-old man admitted at Auckland Hospital. He was attended by Dr. Edward Jones at Date: 06/01/2008 . He has a past medical history significant for uncontrolled HTN who presents with a non-reducible right inguinal hernia. Patient first noticed a right sided bulge in 3 months prior. Every day it slips out and he has to manually push it back it. He has had to present to the emergency room twice recently when he was unable to push it back it. He was pending an outpatient repair of his right inguinal hernia.What are the assessment and recommendations for this patient?Figure 2: Framework overview. (a) To mitigate privacy leakage, we use a keyword extractor to obtain medical keywords. Clinicians then create several contexts based on these keywords and candidate answers, which the LLM uses to produce privacy-restricted contexts.

Although existing methods offer input attributions as explanations for a model's prediction, it is still unclear how prior words affect the model's decision throughout the layers. In this work, we leverage recent advances in explainability of the Transformer and present a procedure to analyze models for language generation. Using contrastive examples, we compare the alignment of our explanations with evidence of the linguistic phenomena, and show that our method consistently aligns better than gradient-based and perturbation-based baselines. Then, we investigate the role of MLPs inside the Transformer and show that they learn features that help the model predict words that are grammatically acceptable. Lastly, we apply our method to Neural Machine Translation models, and demonstrate that they generate human-like source-target alignments for building predictions",,,
258832670,ControlVideo: Training-free Controllable Text-to-Video Generation,"Text-driven diffusion models have unlocked unprecedented abilities in image generation, whereas their video counterpart still lags behind due to the excessive training cost of temporal modeling. Besides the training burden, the generated videos also suffer from appearance inconsistency and structural flickers, especially in long video synthesis. To address these challenges, we design a training-free framework called ControlVideo to enable natural and efficient text-to-video generation. ControlVideo, adapted from ControlNet, leverages coarsely structural consistency from input motion sequences, and introduces three modules to improve video generation. Firstly, to ensure appearance coherence between frames, ControlVideo adds fully cross-frame interaction in self-attention modules. Secondly, to mitigate the flicker effect, it introduces an interleaved-frame smoother that employs frame interpolation on alternated frames. Finally, to produce long videos efficiently, it utilizes a hierarchical sampler that separately synthesizes each short clip with holistic coherency. Empowered with these modules, ControlVideo outperforms the state-of-the-arts on extensive motion-prompt pairs quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, thanks to the efficient designs, it generates both short and long videos within several minutes using one NVIDIA 2080Ti. Code is available at https://github.com/YBYBZhang/ControlVideo.Recent studies[15,40]have explored leveraging the structure controllability of ControlNet[43]or DDIM inversion [35] for video generation. Rather than synthesizing all frames independently,[15,40]enhance appearance coherence by replacing original self-attention with the sparser crossframe attention. Nevertheless, their video quality is still far behind photo-realistic videos in terms of: (i) inconsistent appearance between some frames (seeFig. 4 (a)), (ii) visible artifacts in large motion videos (seeFig. 4(b)), and (iii) structural flickers during inter-frame transitions.

258832820,Is Fine-tuning Needed? Pre-trained Language Models Are Near Perfect for Out-of-Domain Detection,"Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task for reliable predictions over text. Finetuning with pre-trained language models has been a de facto procedure to derive OOD detectors with respect to in-distribution (ID) data. Despite its common use, the understanding of the role of fine-tuning and its necessity for OOD detection is largely unexplored. In this paper, we raise the question: is fine-tuning necessary for OOD detection? We present a study investigating the efficacy of directly leveraging pre-trained language models for OOD detection, without any model fine-tuning on the ID data. We compare the approach with several competitive fine-tuning objectives, and offer new insights under various types of distributional shifts. Extensive evaluations on 8 diverse ID-OOD dataset pairs demonstrate nearperfect OOD detection performance (with 0% FPR95 in many cases), strongly outperforming its fine-tuned counterparts. We show that using distance-based detection methods, pretrained language models are near-perfect OOD detectors when the distribution shift involves a domain change. Furthermore, we study the effect of fine-tuning on OOD detection and identify how to balance ID accuracy with OOD detection performance. Our code is publically available 1 .",,,
258832833,Dynamic Transformers Provide a False Sense of Efficiency,"Despite much success in natural language processing (NLP), pre-trained language models typically lead to a high computational cost during inference. Multi-exit is a mainstream approach to address this issue by making a tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy, where the saving of computation comes from an early exit. However, whether such saving from earlyexiting is robust remains unknown. Motivated by this, we first show that directly adapting existing adversarial attack approaches targeting model accuracy cannot significantly reduce inference efficiency. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective attacking framework, SAME, a novel slowdown attack framework on multi-exit models, which is specially tailored to reduce the efficiency of the multi-exit models. By leveraging the multi-exit models' design characteristics, we utilize all internal predictions to guide the adversarial sample generation instead of merely considering the final prediction. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark show that SAME can effectively diminish the efficiency gain of various multi-exit models by 80% on average, convincingly validating its effectiveness and generalization ability.",,,
258832883,Gloss-Free End-to-End Sign Language Translation,"In this paper, we tackle the problem of sign language translation (SLT) without gloss annotations. Although intermediate representation like gloss has been proven effective, gloss annotations are hard to acquire, especially in large quantities. This limits the domain coverage of translation datasets, thus handicapping real-world applications. To mitigate this problem, we design the Gloss-Free End-to-end sign language translation framework (GloFE). Our method improves the performance of SLT in the gloss-free setting by exploiting the shared underlying semantics of signs and the corresponding spoken translation. Common concepts are extracted from the text and used as a weak form of intermediate representation. The global embedding of these concepts is used as a query for cross-attention to find the corresponding information within the learned visual features. In a contrastive manner, we encourage the similarity of query results between samples containing such concepts and decrease those that do not. We obtained state-of-the-art results on large-scale datasets, including OpenASL and How2Sign. 1",,,
258833194,Semantic Structure Enhanced Event Causality Identification,"Event Causality Identification (ECI) aims to identify causal relations between events in unstructured texts. This is a very challenging task, because causal relations are usually expressed by implicit associations between events. Existing methods usually capture such associations by directly modeling the texts with pre-trained language models, which underestimate two kinds of semantic structures vital to the ECI task, namely, event-centric structure and eventassociated structure. The former includes important semantic elements related to the events to describe them more precisely, while the latter contains semantic paths between two events to provide possible supports for ECI. In this paper, we study the implicit associations between events by modeling the above explicit semantic structures, and propose a Semantic Structure Integration model (SemSIn). It utilizes a GNN-based event aggregator to integrate the event-centric structure information, and employs an LSTM-based path aggregator to capture the event-associated structure information between two events. Experimental results on three widely used datasets show that SemSIn achieves significant improvements over baseline methods.",,,
258833272,Time Fairness in Online Knapsack Problems,"The online knapsack problem is a classic problem in the field of online algorithms. Its canonical version asks how to pack items of different values and weights arriving online into a capacity-limited knapsack so as to maximize the total value of the admitted items. Although optimal competitive algorithms are known for this problem, they may be fundamentally unfair, i.e., individual items may be treated inequitably in different ways. Inspired by recent attention to fairness in online settings, we develop a natural and practically-relevant notion of time fairness for the online knapsack problem, and show that the existing optimal algorithms perform poorly under this metric. We propose a parameterized deterministic algorithm where the parameter precisely captures the Pareto-optimal trade-off between fairness and competitiveness. We show that randomization is theoretically powerful enough to be simultaneously competitive and fair; however, it does not work well in practice, using trace-driven experiments. To further improve the trade-off between fairness and competitiveness, we develop a fair, robust (competitive), and consistent learning-augmented algorithm with substantial performance improvement in trace-driven experiments.Preprint.

258833648,Lifting the Curse of Capacity Gap in Distilling Language Models,"Pretrained language models (LMs) have shown compelling performance on various downstream tasks, but unfortunately they require a tremendous amount of inference compute. Knowledge distillation finds a path to compress LMs to small ones with a teacher-student paradigm. However, when the capacity gap between the teacher and the student is large, a curse of capacity gap appears, invoking a deficiency in distilling LMs. While a few studies have been carried out to fill the gap, the curse is not yet well tackled. In this paper, we aim at lifting the curse of capacity gap via enlarging the capacity of the student without notably increasing the inference compute. Largely motivated by sparse activation regime of mixture of experts (MOE), we propose a mixture of minimal experts (MINIMOE), which imposes extra parameters to the student but introduces almost no additional inference compute. Experimental results on GLUE and CoNLL demonstrate the curse of capacity gap is lifted by the magic of MINIMOE to a large extent. MINIMOE also achieves the state-of-the-art performance at small FLOPs compared with a range of competitive baselines. With a compression rate as much as ∼50×, MINIMOE preserves ∼95% GLUE score of the teacher.",,,
258833682,Annealing Self-Distillation Rectification Improves Adversarial Training,"In standard adversarial training, models are optimized to fit one-hot labels within allowable adversarial perturbation budgets. However, the ignorance of underlying distribution shifts brought by perturbations causes the problem of robust overfitting. To address this issue and enhance adversarial robustness, we analyze the characteristics of robust models and identify that robust models tend to produce smoother and well-calibrated outputs. Based on the observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, Annealing Self-Distillation Rectification (ADR), which generates soft labels as a better guidance mechanism that accurately reflects the distribution shift under attack during adversarial training. By utilizing ADR, we can obtain rectified distributions that significantly improve model robustness without the need for pre-trained models or extensive extra computation. Moreover, our method facilitates seamless plug-and-play integration with other adversarial training techniques by replacing the hard labels in their objectives. We demonstrate the efficacy of ADR through extensive experiments and strong performances across datasets.Preprint. Under review.",,,
258835696,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 NEURAL IMPLICIT SHAPE EDITING USING BOUNDARY SENSITIVITY,"Neural fields are receiving increased attention as a geometric representation due to their ability to compactly store detailed and smooth shapes and easily undergo topological changes. Compared to classic geometry representations, however, neural representations do not allow the user to exert intuitive control over the shape. Motivated by this, we leverage boundary sensitivity to express how perturbations in parameters move the shape boundary. This allows to interpret the effect of each learnable parameter and study achievable deformations. With this, we perform geometric editing: finding a parameter update that best approximates a globally prescribed deformation. Prescribing the deformation only locally allows the rest of the shape to change according to some prior, such as semantics or deformation rigidity. Our method is agnostic to the model its training and updates the NN in-place. Furthermore, we show how boundary sensitivity helps to optimize and constrain objectives (such as surface area and volume), which are difficult to compute without first converting to another representation, such as a mesh.",,,
258841145,Element-aware Summarization with Large Language Models: Expert-aligned Evaluation and Chain-of-Thought Method,"Automatic summarization generates concise summaries that contain key ideas of source documents. As the most mainstream datasets for the news sub-domain, CNN/DailyMail and BBC XSum have been widely used for performance benchmarking. However, the reference summaries of those datasets turn out to be noisy, mainly in terms of factual hallucination and information redundancy. To address this challenge, we first annotate new expertwriting Element-aware test sets following the ""Lasswell Communication Model"" proposed by Lasswell (1948), allowing reference summaries to focus on more fine-grained news elements objectively and comprehensively. Utilizing the new test sets, we observe the surprising zero-shot summary ability of LLMs, which addresses the issue of the inconsistent results between human preference and automatic evaluation metrics of LLMs' zero-shot summaries in prior work. Further, we propose a Summary Chain-of-Thought (SumCoT) technique to elicit LLMs to generate summaries step by step, which helps them integrate more finegrained details of source documents into the final summaries that correlate with the human writing mindset. Experimental results show our method outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuned PLMs and zero-shot LLMs by +4.33/+4.77 in ROUGE-L on the two datasets, respectively.

258865243,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 LEVERAGING FUTURE RELATIONSHIP REASONING FOR VEHICLE TRAJECTORY PREDICTION,"Understanding the interaction between multiple agents is crucial for realistic vehicle trajectory prediction. Existing methods have attempted to infer the interaction from the observed past trajectories of agents using pooling, attention, or graph-based methods, which rely on a deterministic approach. However, these methods can fail under complex road structures, as they cannot predict various interactions that may occur in the future. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses lane information to predict a stochastic future relationship among agents. To obtain a coarse future motion of agents, our method first predicts the probability of lanelevel waypoint occupancy of vehicles. We then utilize the temporal probability of passing adjacent lanes for each agent pair, assuming that agents passing adjacent lanes will highly interact. We also model the interaction using a probabilistic distribution, which allows for multiple possible future interactions. The distribution is learned from the posterior distribution of interaction obtained from ground truth future trajectories. We validate our method on popular trajectory prediction datasets: nuScenes and Argoverse. The results show that the proposed method brings remarkable performance gain in prediction accuracy, and achieves state-ofthe-art performance in long-term prediction benchmark dataset.",,,
258865260,GENEVA: Benchmarking Generalizability for Event Argument Extraction with Hundreds of Event Types and Argument Roles,"Recent works in Event Argument Extraction (EAE) have focused on improving model generalizability to cater to new events and domains. However, standard benchmarking datasets like ACE and ERE cover less than 40 event types and 25 entity-centric argument roles. Limited diversity and coverage hinder these datasets from adequately evaluating the generalizability of EAE models. In this paper, we first contribute by creating a large and diverse EAE ontology. This ontology is created by transforming FrameNet, a comprehensive semantic role labeling (SRL) dataset for EAE, by exploiting the similarity between these two tasks. Then, exhaustive human expert annotations are collected to build the ontology, concluding with 115 events and 220 argument roles, with a significant portion of roles not being entities. We utilize this ontology to further introduce GENEVA, a diverse generalizability benchmarking dataset comprising four test suites, aimed at evaluating models' ability to handle limited data and unseen event type generalization. We benchmark six EAE models from various families. The results show that owing to non-entity argument roles, even the best-performing model can only achieve 39% F1 score, indicating how GENEVA provides new challenges for generalization in EAE. Overall, our large and diverse EAE ontology can aid in creating more comprehensive future resources, while GENEVA is a challenging benchmarking dataset encouraging further research for improving generalizability in EAE.",,,

258865597,Sharpness-Aware Data Poisoning Attack,"Recent research has highlighted the vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) against data poisoning attacks. These attacks aim to inject poisoning samples into the models' training dataset such that the trained models have inference failures. While previous studies have executed different types of attacks, one major challenge that greatly limits their effectiveness is the uncertainty of the re-training process after the injection of poisoning samples, including the re-training initialization or algorithms. To address this challenge, we propose a novel attack method called ""Sharpness-Aware Data Poisoning Attack (SAPA)"". In particular, it leverages the concept of DNNs' loss landscape sharpness to optimize the poisoning effect on the worst re-trained model. It helps enhance the preservation of the poisoning effect, regardless of the specific retraining procedure employed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAPA offers a general and principled strategy that significantly enhances various types of poisoning attacks.Preprint.

258866035,CMOT: Cross-modal Mixup via Optimal Transport for Speech Translation,"End-to-end speech translation (ST) is the task of translating speech signals in the source language into text in the target language. As a cross-modal task, end-to-end ST is difficult to train with limited data. Existing methods often try to transfer knowledge from machine translation (MT), but their performances are restricted by the modality gap between speech and text. In this paper, we propose Cross-modal Mixup via Optimal Transport (CMOT) to overcome the modality gap. We find the alignment between speech and text sequences via optimal transport and then mix up the sequences from different modalities at a token level using the alignment. Experiments on the MuST-C ST benchmark demonstrate that CMOT achieves an average BLEU of 30.0 in 8 translation directions, outperforming previous methods. Further analysis shows CMOT can adaptively find the alignment between modalities, which helps alleviate the modality gap between speech and text.",,,
258887491,Towards Higher Pareto Frontier in Multilingual Machine Translation,"Multilingual neural machine translation has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years. However, the long-tailed distribution of multilingual corpora poses a challenge of Pareto optimization, i.e., optimizing for some languages may come at the cost of degrading the performance of others. Existing balancing training strategies are equivalent to a series of Pareto optimal solutions, which trade off on a Pareto frontier 1 . In this work, we propose a new training framework, Pareto Mutual Distillation (Pareto-MD), towards pushing the Pareto frontier outwards rather than making trade-offs. Specifically, Pareto-MD collaboratively trains two Pareto optimal solutions that favor different languages and allows them to learn from the strengths of each other via knowledge distillation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel strategy to enable stronger communication between Pareto optimal solutions and broaden the applicability of our approach. Experimental results on the widely-used WMT and TED datasets show that our method significantly pushes the Pareto frontier and outperforms baselines by up to +2.46 BLEU 2 .",,,
258887582,From Latent Graph to Latent Topology Inference: Differentiable Cell Complex Module,"Latent Graph Inference (LGI) relaxed the reliance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on a given graph topology by dynamically learning it. However, most of LGI methods assume to have a (noisy, incomplete, improvable, ...) input graph to rewire and can solely learn regular graph topologies. In the wake of the success of Topological Deep Learning (TDL), we study Latent Topology Inference (LTI) for learning higher-order cell complexes (with sparse and not regular topology) describing multi-way interactions between data points. To this aim, we introduce the Differentiable Cell Complex Module (DCM), a novel learnable function that computes cell probabilities in the complex to improve the downstream task. We show how to integrate DCM with cell complex message passing networks layers and train it in a end-to-end fashion, thanks to a two-step inference procedure that avoids an exhaustive search across all possible cells in the input, thus maintaining scalability. Our model is tested on several homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets and it is shown to outperform other state-of-the-art techniques, offering significant improvements especially in cases where an input graph is not provided. * Equal contribution.

However, less work has been done on multilingual text simplification due to the lack of a diverse evaluation benchmark that covers complex-simple sentence pairs in many languages. This paper introduces the MULTI-SIM benchmark, a collection of 27 resources in 12 distinct languages containing over 1.7 million complex-simple sentence pairs. This benchmark will encourage research in developing more effective multilingual text simplification models and evaluation metrics. Our experiments using MULTISIM with pre-trained multilingual language models reveal exciting performance improvements from multilingual training in non-English settings. We observe strong performance from Russian in zero-shot crosslingual transfer to low-resource languages. We further show that few-shot prompting with BLOOM-176b achieves comparable quality to reference simplifications outperforming finetuned models in most languages. We validate these findings through human evaluation. 1",,,

Thus, in such a domain, Asking Clarification Questions (ACQs) to reveal users' true intent from their queries or utterances arise as an essential task. However, it is noticeable that a key limitation of the existing ACQs studies is their incomparability, from inconsistent use of data, distinct experimental setups and evaluation strategies. Therefore, in this paper, to assist the development of ACQs techniques, we comprehensively analyse the current ACQs research status, which offers a detailed comparison of publicly available datasets, and discusses the applied evaluation metrics, joined with benchmarks for multiple ACQs-related tasks. In particular, given a thorough analysis of the ACQs task, we discuss a number of corresponding research directions for the investigation of ACQs as well as the development of conversational systems.",,,
258887946,ConvGQR: Generative Query Reformulation for Conversational Search,"In conversational search, the user's real search intent for the current conversation turn is dependent on the previous conversation history. It is challenging to determine a good search query from the whole conversation context. To avoid the expensive re-training of the query encoder, most existing methods try to learn a rewriting model to de-contextualize the current query by mimicking the manual query rewriting. However, manually rewritten queries are not always the best search queries. Thus, training a rewriting model on them would lead to sub-optimal queries. Another useful information to enhance the search query is the potential answer to the question. In this paper, we propose ConvGQR, a new framework to reformulate conversational queries based on generative pre-trained language models (PLMs), one for query rewriting and another for generating potential answers. By combining both, ConvGQR can produce better search queries. In addition, to relate query reformulation to the retrieval task, we propose a knowledge infusion mechanism to optimize both query reformulation and retrieval. Extensive experiments on four conversational search datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ConvGQR.",,,
258947156,Model-Based Simulation for Optimising Smart Reply,"Smart Reply (SR) systems present a user with a set of replies, of which one can be selected in place of having to type out a response. To perform well at this task, a system should be able to effectively present the user with a diverse set of options, to maximise the chance that at least one of them conveys the user's desired response. This is a significant challenge, due to the lack of datasets containing sets of responses to learn from. Resultantly, previous work has focused largely on post-hoc diversification, rather than explicitly learning to predict sets of responses. Motivated by this problem, we present a novel method SIMSR, that employs model-based simulation to discover high-value response sets, through simulating possible user responses with a learned world model. Unlike previous approaches, this allows our method to directly optimise the end-goal of SR-maximising the relevance of at least one of the predicted replies. Empirically on two public datasets, when compared to SoTA baselines, our method achieves up to 21% and 18% improvement in ROUGE score and Self-ROUGE score respectively.",,,

258947273,ALIGNSCORE: Evaluating Factual Consistency with A Unified Alignment Function,"Many text generation applications require the generated text to be factually consistent with input information. Automatic evaluation of factual consistency is challenging. Previous work has developed various metrics that often depend on specific functions, such as natural language inference (NLI) or question answering (QA), trained on limited data. Those metrics thus can hardly assess diverse factual inconsistencies (e.g., contradictions, hallucinations) that occur in varying inputs/outputs (e.g., sentences, documents) from different tasks. In this paper, we propose ALIGNSCORE, a new holistic metric that applies to a variety of factual inconsistency scenarios as above. ALIGN-SCORE is based on a general function of information alignment between two arbitrary text pieces. Crucially, we develop a unified training framework of the alignment function by integrating a large diversity of data sources, resulting in 4.7M training examples from 7 well-established tasks (NLI, QA, paraphrasing, fact verification, information retrieval, semantic similarity, and summarization). We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks including 22 evaluation datasets, where 19 of the datasets were never seen in the alignment training. ALIGNSCORE achieves substantial improvement over a wide range of previous metrics. Moreover, ALIGNSCORE (355M parameters) matches or even outperforms metrics based on ChatGPT and GPT-4 that are orders of magnitude larger. 1",,,

This resource is designed to ground flexible normative reasoning for interactive, assistive, and collaborative AI systems. Unlike prior commonsense resources, NORMBANK grounds each inference within a multivalent sociocultural frame, which includes the setting (e.g., restaurant), the agents' contingent roles (waiter, customer), their attributes (age, gender), and other physical, social, and cultural constraints (e.g., the temperature or the country of operation). In total, NORMBANK contains 63k unique constraints from a taxonomy that we introduce and iteratively refine here. Constraints then apply in different combinations to frame social norms. Under these manipulations, norms are non-monotonic -one can cancel an inference by updating its frame even slightly. Still, we find evidence that neural models can help reliably extend the scope and coverage of NORMBANK. We further demonstrate the utility of this resource with a series of transfer experiments.

Nonetheless, various PEFT methods are limited by their inherent characteristics. In the case of sparse fine-tuning, which involves modifying only a small subset of the existing parameters, the selection of fine-tuned parameters is task-and domain-specific, making it unsuitable for federated learning. On the other hand, PEFT methods with adding new parameters typically introduce additional inference latency. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of generating a sparse mask in a task-agnostic manner, wherein all downstream tasks share a common mask. Our approach, which relies solely on the magnitude information of pre-trained parameters, surpasses existing methodologies by a significant margin when evaluated on the GLUE benchmark. Additionally, we introduce a novel adapter technique that directly applies the adapter to pre-trained parameters instead of the hidden representation, thereby achieving identical inference speed to that of full finetuning.

In this work, we present ATINTER, a model that intercepts and learns to rewrite adversarial inputs to make them non-adversarial for a downstream text classifier. Our experiments on four datasets and five attack mechanisms reveal that ATINTER is effective at providing better adversarial robustness than existing defense approaches, without compromising task accuracy. For example, on sentiment classification using the SST-2 dataset, our method improves the adversarial accuracy over the best existing defense approach by more than 4% with a smaller decrease in task accuracy (0.5 % vs. 2.5%). Moreover, we show that ATINTER generalizes across multiple downstream tasks and classifiers without having to explicitly retrain it for those settings. For example, we find that when ATINTER is trained to remove adversarial perturbations for the sentiment classification task on the SST-2 dataset, it even transfers to a semantically different task of news classification (on AGNews) and improves the adversarial robustness by more than 10%.",,,
258947837,Soft Alignment Objectives for Robust Adaptation of Language Generation,"Domain adaptation allows generative language models to address specific flaws caused by the domain shift of their application. However, the traditional adaptation by further training on indomain data rapidly weakens the model's ability to generalize to other domains, making the openended deployments of the adapted models prone to errors. This work introduces novel training objectives built upon a semantic similarity of the predicted tokens to the reference.Our results show that (1) avoiding the common assumption of a single correct prediction by constructing the training target from tokens' semantic similarity can largely mitigate catastrophic forgetting of adaptation, while (2) preserving the adaptation in-domain quality, (3) with negligible additions to compute costs. In the broader context, the objectives grounded in a continuous token similarity pioneer the exploration of the middle ground between the efficient but naïve exact-match token-level objectives and expressive but computationally-and resourceintensive sequential objectives. . 2020.

We create CrossSum by aligning parallel articles written in different languages via cross-lingual retrieval from a multilingual abstractive summarization dataset and perform a controlled human evaluation to validate its quality. We propose a multistage data sampling algorithm to effectively train a cross-lingual summarization model capable of summarizing an article in any target language. We also introduce LaSE, an embedding-based metric for automatically evaluating model-generated summaries. LaSE is strongly correlated with ROUGE and, unlike ROUGE, can be reliably measured even in the absence of references in the target language. Performance on ROUGE and LaSE indicate that our proposed model consistently outperforms baseline models. To the best of our knowledge, CrossSum is the largest cross-lingual summarization dataset and the first ever that is not centered around English. We are releasing the dataset, training and evaluation scripts, and models to spur future research on cross-lingual summarization.

258959081,Dense-ATOMIC: Towards Densely-connected ATOMIC with High Knowledge Coverage and Massive Multi-hop Paths,"ATOMIC is a large-scale commonsense knowledge graph (CSKG) containing everyday ifthen knowledge triplets, i.e., {head event, relation, tail event}. The one-hop annotation manner made ATOMIC a set of independent bipartite graphs, which ignored the numerous links between events in different bipartite graphs and consequently caused shortages in knowledge coverage and multi-hop paths. In this work, we aim to construct Dense-ATOMIC with high knowledge coverage and massive multi-hop paths. The events in ATOMIC are normalized to a consistent pattern at first. We then propose a CSKG completion method called Rel-CSKGC to predict the relation given the head event and the tail event of a triplet, and train a CSKG completion model based on existing triplets in ATOMIC. We finally utilize the model to complete the missing links in ATOMIC and accordingly construct Dense-ATOMIC. Both automatic and human evaluation on an annotated subgraph of ATOMIC demonstrate the advantage of Rel-CSKGC over strong baselines. We further conduct extensive evaluations on Dense-ATOMIC in terms of statistics, human evaluation, and simple downstream tasks, all proving Dense-ATOMIC's advantages in Knowledge",,,
258959097,In-Context Analogical Reasoning with Pre-Trained Language Models,"Analogical reasoning is a fundamental capacity of human cognition that allows us to reason abstractly about novel situations by relating them to past experiences. While it is thought to be essential for robust reasoning in AI systems, conventional approaches require significant training and/or hard-coding of domain knowledge to be applied to benchmark tasks. Inspired by cognitive science research that has found connections between human language and analogy-making, we explore the use of intuitive language-based abstractions to support analogy in AI systems. Specifically, we apply large pre-trained language models (PLMs) to visual Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM), a common relational reasoning test. By simply encoding the perceptual features of the problem into language form, we find that PLMs exhibit a striking capacity for zero-shot relational reasoning, exceeding human performance and nearing supervised vision-based methods. We explore different encodings that vary the level of abstraction over task features, finding that higherlevel abstractions further strengthen PLMs' analogical reasoning. Our detailed analysis reveals insights on the role of model complexity, incontext learning, and prior knowledge in solving RPM tasks.",,,
258959116,MPCHAT: Towards Multimodal Persona-Grounded Conversation,"In order to build self-consistent personalized dialogue agents, previous research has mostly focused on textual persona that delivers personal facts or personalities. However, to fully describe the multi-faceted nature of persona, image modality can help better reveal the speaker's personal characteristics and experiences in episodic memory (Rubin et al.,  2003; Conway, 2009). In this work, we extend persona-based dialogue to the multimodal domain and make two main contributions. First, we present the first multimodal persona-based dialogue dataset named MPCHAT, which extends persona with both text and images to contain episodic memories. Second, we empirically show that incorporating multimodal persona, as measured by three proposed multimodal persona-grounded dialogue tasks (i.e., next response prediction, grounding persona prediction, and speaker identification), leads to statistically significant performance improvements across all tasks. Thus, our work highlights that multimodal persona is crucial for improving multimodal dialogue comprehension, and our MPCHAT serves as a high-quality resource for this research. . 2022.Fine-grained image captioning with CLIP reward.

258959201,FERMAT: An Alternative to Accuracy for Numerical Reasoning,"While pre-trained language models achieve impressive performance on various NLP benchmarks, they still struggle with tasks that require numerical reasoning. Recent advances in improving numerical reasoning are mostly achieved using very large language models that contain billions of parameters and are not accessible to everyone. In addition, numerical reasoning is measured using a single score on existing datasets. As a result, we do not have a clear understanding of the strengths and shortcomings of existing models on different numerical reasoning aspects and therefore, potential ways to improve them apart from scaling them up. Inspired by CheckList (Ribeiro et al., 2020), we introduce a multi-view evaluation set for numerical reasoning in English, called FERMAT. Instead of reporting a single score on a whole dataset, FERMAT evaluates models on various key numerical reasoning aspects such as number understanding, mathematical operations, and training dependency. Apart from providing a comprehensive evaluation of models on different numerical reasoning aspects, FERMAT enables a systematic and automated generation of an arbitrarily large training or evaluation set for each aspect.The datasets and codes are publicly available to generate further multi-view data for ulterior tasks and languages. 1",,,
258959382,PuMer: Pruning and Merging Tokens for Efficient Vision Language Models,"Large-scale vision language (VL) models use Transformers to perform cross-modal interactions between the input text and image. These cross-modal interactions are computationally expensive and memory-intensive due to the quadratic complexity of processing the input image and text. We present PuMer 1 : a token reduction framework that uses text-informed Pruning and modality-aware Merging strategies to progressively reduce the tokens of input image and text, improving model inference speed and reducing memory footprint. PuMer learns to keep salient image tokens related to the input text and merges similar textual and visual tokens by adding lightweight token reducer modules at several cross-modal layers in the VL model. Training PuMer is mostly the same as finetuning the original VL model but faster. Our evaluation for two vision language models on four downstream VL tasks shows PuMer increases inference throughput by up to 2x and reduces memory footprint by over 50% while incurring less than a 1% accuracy drop. 2",,,
258960101,DNA-GPT: DIVERGENT N-GRAM ANALYSIS FOR TRAINING-FREE DETECTION OF GPT-GENERATED TEXT,"Large language models (LLMs) have notably enhanced the fluency and diversity of machine-generated text.However, this progress also presents a significant challenge in detecting the origin of a given text, and current research on detection methods lags behind the rapid evolution of LLMs.Conventional training-based methods have limitations in flexibility, particularly when adapting to new domains, and they often lack explanatory power.To address this gap, we propose a novel training-free detection strategy called Divergent N-Gram Analysis (DNA-GPT).Given a text, we first truncate it in the middle and then use only the preceding portion as input to the LLMs to regenerate the new remaining parts.By analyzing the differences between the original and new remaining parts through N-gram analysis in black-box or probability divergence in white-box, we unveil significant discrepancies between the distribution of machine-generated text and the distribution of human-written text.We conducted extensive experiments on the most advanced LLMs from Ope-nAI, including text-davinci-003, GPT-3.5-turbo, and GPT-4, as well as open-source models such as GPT-NeoX-20B and LLaMa-13B.Results show that our zero-shot approach exhibits state-of-the-art performance in distinguishing between human and GPT-generated text on four English and one German dataset, outperforming OpenAI's own classifier, which is trained on millions of text.Additionally, our methods provide reasonable explanations and evidence to support our claim, which is a unique feature of explainable detection.Our method is also robust under the revised text attack and can additionally solve model sourcing.Codes are available at https://github.com/Xianjun-Yang/DNA-GPT",,,

However, current studies on TIT are confronted with two main bottlenecks: 1) this task lacks a publicly available TIT dataset, 2) dominant models are constructed in a cascaded manner, which tends to suffer from the error propagation of optical character recognition (OCR). In this work, we first annotate a Chinese-English TIT dataset named OCRMT30K, providing convenience for subsequent studies. Then, we propose a TIT model with a multimodal codebook, which is able to associate the image with relevant texts, providing useful supplementary information for translation. Moreover, we present a multi-stage training framework involving text machine translation, image-text alignment, and TIT tasks, which fully exploits additional bilingual texts, OCR dataset and our OCRMT30K dataset to train our model.

Existing works focus on coping with this concern while interacting with ill-intentioned users, such as those who explicitly make hate speech or elicit harmful responses. However, discussions on sensitive issues can become toxic even if the users are well-intentioned. For safer models in such scenarios, we present the Sensitive Questions and Acceptable Response (SQUARE) dataset, a large-scale Korean dataset of 49k sensitive questions with 42k acceptable and 46k non-acceptable responses.

258960443,Query-Efficient Black-Box Red Teaming via Bayesian Optimization,"The deployment of large-scale generative models is often restricted by their potential risk of causing harm to users in unpredictable ways. We focus on the problem of black-box red teaming, where a red team generates test cases and interacts with the victim model to discover a diverse set of failures with limited query access. Existing red teaming methods construct test cases based on human supervision or language model (LM) and query all test cases in a brute-force manner without incorporating any information from past evaluations, resulting in a prohibitively large number of queries. To this end, we propose Bayesian red teaming (BRT), novel query-efficient blackbox red teaming methods based on Bayesian optimization, which iteratively identify diverse positive test cases leading to model failures by utilizing the pre-defined user input pool and the past evaluations. Experimental results on various user input pools demonstrate that our method consistently finds a significantly larger number of diverse positive test cases under the limited query budget than the baseline methods.

258960642,"One Network, Many Masks: Towards More Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning","Fine-tuning pre-trained language models for multiple tasks tends to be expensive in terms of storage. To mitigate this, parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they still require a significant number of parameters and storage when being applied to broader ranges of tasks. To achieve even greater storage reduction, we propose PROPETL, a novel method that enables efficient sharing of a single PETL module which we call prototype network (e.g., adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning) across layers and tasks. We then learn binary masks to select different sub-networks from the shared prototype network and apply them as PETL modules into different layers. We find that the binary masks can determine crucial information from the network, which is often ignored in previous studies. Our work can also be seen as a type of pruning method, where we find that overparameterization also exists in the seemingly small PETL modules. We evaluate PROPETL on various downstream tasks and show that it can outperform other PETL methods with approximately 10% of the parameter storage required by the latter.",,,
258967312,SWIPE: A Dataset for Document-Level Simplification of Wikipedia Pages,"Text simplification research has mostly focused on sentence-level simplification, even though many desirable edits-such as adding relevant background information or reordering contentmay require document-level context. Prior work has also predominantly framed simplification as a single-step, input-to-output task, only implicitly modeling the fine-grained, span-level edits that elucidate the simplification process. To address both gaps, we introduce the SWIPE dataset, which reconstructs the document-level editing process from English Wikipedia (EW) articles to paired Simple Wikipedia (SEW) articles. In contrast to prior work, SWIPE leverages the entire revision history when pairing pages in order to better identify simplification edits. We work with Wikipedia editors to annotate 5,000 EW-SEW document pairs, labeling more than 40,000 edits with proposed 19 categories. To scale our efforts, we propose several models to automatically label edits, achieving an F-1 score of up to 70.6, indicating that this is a tractable but challenging NLU task. Finally, we categorize the edits produced by several simplification models and find that SWIPE-trained models generate more complex edits while reducing unwanted edits.",,,
258967524,LayoutMask: Enhance Text-Layout Interaction in Multi-modal Pre-training for Document Understanding,"Visually-rich Document Understanding (VrDU) has attracted much research attention over the past years. Pre-trained models on a large number of document images with transformer-based backbones have led to significant performance gains in this field. The major challenge is how to fusion the different modalities (text, layout, and image) of the documents in a unified model with different pre-training tasks. This paper focuses on improving text-layout interactions and proposes a novel multi-modal pre-training model, LayoutMask. LayoutMask uses local 1D position, instead of global 1D position, as layout input and has two pre-training objectives: (1) Masked Language Modeling: predicting masked tokens with two novel masking strategies; (2) Masked Position Modeling: predicting masked 2D positions to improve layout representation learning. LayoutMask can enhance the interactions between text and layout modalities in a unified model and produce adaptive and robust multimodal representations for downstream tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of VrDU problems, including form understanding, receipt understanding, and document image classification.",,,

Although there is a public dataset for triplet-based persona attribute extraction from conversations, its automatically generated labels present many issues, including unspecific relations and inconsistent annotations. We fix such issues by leveraging more reliable text-label matching criteria to generate high-quality data for persona attribute extraction. We also propose a contrastive learning-and generation-based model with a novel hard negative sampling strategy for generalized zero-shot persona attribute extraction.

Our sampling strategy also exceeds others by a large margin in persona attribute extraction.",,,
258987457,I Cast Detect Thoughts: Learning to Converse and Guide with Intents and Theory-of-Mind in Dungeons and Dragons,"We propose a novel task, G4C, to study teacher-student natural language interactions in a goal-driven and grounded environment. Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), a role-playing game, provides an ideal setting to investigate such interactions. Here, the Dungeon Master (DM), i.e., the teacher, guides the actions of several players-students, each with their own personas and abilities-to achieve shared goals grounded in a fantasy world. Our approach is to decompose and model these interactions into (1) the DM's intent to guide players towards a given goal; (2) the DM's guidance utterance to the players expressing this intent; and (3) a theory-of-mind (ToM) model that anticipates the players' reaction to the guidance one turn into the future. We develop a novel reinforcement learning (RL) method for training a DM that generates guidance for players by rewarding utterances where the intent matches the ToM-anticipated player actions. Human and automated evaluations show that a DM trained to explicitly model intents and incorporate ToM of the players using RL generates better-quality guidance that is 3x more likely to fulfill the DM's intent than a vanilla natural language generation (NLG) approach.",,,
258988004,Breeding Machine Translations: Evolutionary approach to survive and thrive in the world of automated evaluation,"We propose a genetic algorithm (GA) based method for modifying n-best lists produced by a machine translation (MT) system. Our method offers an innovative approach to improving MT quality and identifying weaknesses in evaluation metrics. Using common GA operations (mutation and crossover) on a list of hypotheses in combination with a fitness function (an arbitrary MT metric), we obtain novel and diverse outputs with high metric scores. With a combination of multiple MT metrics as the fitness function, the proposed method leads to an increase in translation quality as measured by other held-out automatic metrics. With a single metric (including popular ones such as COMET) as the fitness function, we find blind spots and flaws in the metric. This allows for an automated search for adversarial examples in an arbitrary metric, without prior assumptions on the form of such example. As a demonstration of the method, we create datasets of adversarial examples and use them to show that reference-free COMET is substantially less robust than the reference-based version.",,,
258999673,EEL: Efficiently Encoding Lattices for Reranking,"Standard decoding approaches for conditional text generation tasks typically search for an output hypothesis with high model probability, but this may not yield the best hypothesis according to human judgments of quality. Reranking to optimize for downstream metrics can better optimize for quality, but many metrics of interest are computed with pre-trained language models, which are slow to apply to large numbers of hypotheses. We explore an approach for reranking hypotheses by using Transformers to efficiently encode lattices of generated outputs, a method we call EEL. With a single Transformer pass over the entire lattice, we can approximately compute a contextualized representation of each token as if it were only part of a single hypothesis in isolation. We combine this approach with a new class of token-factored rerankers (TFRs) that allow for efficient extraction of high reranker-scoring hypotheses from the lattice. Empirically, our approach incurs minimal degradation error compared to the exponentially slower approach of encoding each hypothesis individually. When applying EEL with TFRs across three text generation tasks, our results show both substantial speedup compared to naive reranking and often better performance on downstream metrics than comparable approaches.",,,

Rethinking the Effectiveness of Task Definitions in Instruction Learning,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in following natural language instructions to solve unseen tasks. However, it remains unclear whether models truly understand task definitions and whether the human-written definitions are optimal. In this paper, we systematically study the role of task definitions in instruction learning. We first conduct an ablation analysis informed by human annotations to understand which parts of a task definition are most important, and find that model performance only drops substantially when removing contents describing the task output, in particular label information. Next, we propose an automatic algorithm to compress task definitions to a minimal supporting set of tokens, and find that 60% of tokens can be removed while maintaining or even improving model performance. Based on these results, we propose two strategies to help models better leverage task instructions: (1) providing only key information for tasks in a common structured format, and (2) adding a metatuning stage to help the model better understand the definitions. With these two strategies, we achieve a 4.2 Rouge-L improvement over 119 unseen test tasks. naneh Hajishirzi. 2022a.

The difficulty of this procedure is exacerbated by the fact that the number of academic publications is growing exponentially. In this study, we devise a framework based on concept co-occurrence for academic idea inspiration, which has been integrated into a research assistant system. From our perspective, the fusion of two concepts that co-occur in an academic paper can be regarded as an important way of the emergence of a new idea. We construct evolving concept graphs according to the co-occurrence relationship of concepts from 20 disciplines or topics. Then we design a temporal link prediction method based on masked language model to explore potential connections between different concepts. To verbalize the newly discovered connections, we also utilize the pretrained language model to generate a description of an idea based on a new data structure called co-occurrence citation quintuple. We evaluate our proposed system using both automatic metrics and human assessment. The results demonstrate that our system has broad prospects and can assist researchers in expediting the process of discovering new ideas. 1 , et al. 2020.

In this work, we revisit a widely used conceptualization of framing from the communication sciences which explicitly captures elements of narratives, including conflict and its resolution, and integrate it with the narrative framing of key entities in the story as heroes, victims or villains. We adapt an effective annotation paradigm that breaks a complex annotation task into a series of simpler binary questions, and present an annotated data set of English news articles, and a case study on the framing of climate change in articles from news outlets across the political spectrum. Finally, we explore automatic multi-label prediction of our frames with supervised and semisupervised approaches, and present a novel retrieval-based method which is both effective and transparent in its predictions. We conclude with a discussion of opportunities and challenges for future work on document-level models of narrative framing. 1",,,
259075723,Hiding in Plain Sight: Disguising Data Stealing Attacks in Federated Learning,"Malicious server (MS) attacks have enabled the scaling of data stealing in federated learning to large batch sizes and secure aggregation, settings previously considered private. However, many concerns regarding client-side detectability of MS attacks were raised, questioning their practicality once they are publicly known. In this work, for the first time, we thoroughly study the problem of client-side detectability. We demonstrate that most prior MS attacks, which fundamentally rely on one of two key principles, are detectable by principled client-side checks. Further, we formulate desiderata for practical MS attacks and propose SEER, a novel attack framework that satisfies all desiderata, while stealing user data from gradients of realistic networks, even for large batch sizes (up to 512 in our experiments) and under secure aggregation. The key insight of SEER is the use of a secret decoder, which is jointly trained with the shared model. Our work represents a promising first step towards more principled treatment of MS attacks, paving the way for realistic data stealing that can compromise user privacy in real-world deployments.Most prior MS attacks rely on one of two key underlying principles. One attack class[13,14,15,16]uses malicious model modifications to encourage different types of sparsity in dense layer gradients, enabling the application of analytical honest attacks-we refer to these attacks as boosted analytical.Other attacks utilize example disaggregation[17,18], reducing the effective batch size in the gradient space by restricting the gradient flow, which permits the use of optimization-based honest attacks.Client-side detectability Nearly all prior work in the field[8,13,14,15,19,17,18,20]has raised the issue of client-side detectability of MS attacks, i.e., an FL client may be able to detect malicious server activity, and decide to opt out of the current or all future rounds. Despite such concerns, no attempts have so far been made to study, quantify, or improve client-side detectability of MS attacks.This work: detecting and disguising malicious server attacks In this work, we thoroughly study the question of client-side detectability of MS attacks. We demonstrate that while boosted analytical and example disaggregation attacks pose a real threat as zero-day exploits, now that their key principles are known, all current (and future) attacks from these two classes are client-side detectable in a principled way, bringing into question their practicality. Notably, we demonstrate the detectability of example disaggregation attacks by introducing D-SNR, a novel vulnerability metric.With this in mind, we observe that such limitations of prior MS attacks arise from their fundamental reliance on the honest attacks they lift. Namely, boosted analytical attacks always require handcrafted modifications which are weight-space detectable, and example disaggregation attacks rely on the success of disaggregation, which is equally evident to any party observing the gradients, i.e., it is gradient-space detectable. This illustrates the need for fundamentally different attack approaches.As a promising first step in that direction, we propose a novel attack framework SEER, which recovers data from batch sizes up to 512, yet is by design harder to detect than prior attacks. Our key insights are that (i) gradient-space detection can be evaded using a secret decoder, disaggregating the data in a space unknown to clients, and (ii) jointly optimizing the decoder and the shared model with SGD avoids handcrafted modifications and allows for effective reconstruction. Importantly, SEER does not lift any prior honest attack and does not require restrictive assumptions such as the ability to tweak the architecture, side-channel information, or knowledge of batch normalization data or labels.Key contributions Our work makes the following contributions.",,,
259076194,Learning to Substitute Spans towards Improving Compositional Generalization,"Despite the rising prevalence of neural sequence models, recent empirical evidences suggest their deficiency in compositional generalization. One of the current de-facto solutions to this problem is compositional data augmentation, aiming to incur additional compositional inductive bias. Nonetheless, the improvement offered by existing handcrafted augmentation strategies is limited when successful systematic generalization of neural sequence models requires multi-grained compositional bias (i.e., not limited to either lexical or structural biases only) or differentiation of training sequences in an imbalanced difficulty distribution. To address the two challenges, we first propose a novel compositional augmentation strategy dubbed Span Substitution (SpanSub) that enables multi-grained composition of substantial substructures in the whole training set. Over and above that, we introduce the Learning to Substitute Span (L2S2) framework which empowers the learning of span substitution probabilities in SpanSub in an end-to-end manner by maximizing the loss of neural sequence models, so as to outweigh those challenging compositions with elusive concepts and novel surroundings.

259089125,Learning Multi-Step Reasoning by Solving Arithmetic Tasks,"Mathematical reasoning is regarded as a necessary ability for Language Models (LMs). Recent works demonstrate large LMs' impressive performance in solving math problems. The success is attributed to their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning abilities, i.e., the ability to decompose complex questions into step-by-step reasoning chains, but such ability seems only to emerge from models with abundant parameters. This work investigates how to incorporate relatively small LMs with the capabilities of multi-step reasoning. We propose to inject such abilities by continually pre-training LMs on a synthetic dataset MSAT which is composed of Multi-step Arithmetic Tasks. Our experiments on four math word problem datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing LMs' math reasoning abilities. 1  , et al. 2021.

259093058,Factual or Contextual? Disentangling Error Types in Entity Description Generation,"In the task of entity description generation, given a context and a specified entity, a model must describe that entity correctly and in a contextually-relevant way. In this task, as well as broader language generation tasks, the generation of a nonfactual description (factual error) versus an incongruous description (contextual error) is fundamentally different, yet often conflated. We develop an evaluation paradigm that enables us to disentangle these two types of errors in naturally occurring textual contexts. We find that factuality and congruity are often at odds, and that models specifically struggle with accurate descriptions of entities that are less familiar to people. This shortcoming of language models raises concerns around the trustworthiness of such models, since factual errors on less well-known entities are exactly those that a human reader will not recognize.",,,
259095910,Knowledge-Augmented Language Model Prompting for Zero-Shot Knowledge Graph Question Answering,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of performing zero-shot closed-book question answering tasks, based on their internal knowledge stored in parameters during pre-training. However, such internalized knowledge might be insufficient and incorrect, which could lead LLMs to generate factually wrong answers. Furthermore, fine-tuning LLMs to update their knowledge is expensive. To this end, we propose to augment the knowledge directly in the input of LLMs. Specifically, we first retrieve the relevant facts to the input question from the knowledge graph based on semantic similarities between the question and its associated facts. After that, we prepend the retrieved facts to the input question in the form of the prompt, which is then forwarded to LLMs to generate the answer. Our framework, Knowledge-Augmented language model PromptING (KAP-ING), requires no model training, thus completely zero-shot. We validate the performance of our KAPING framework on the knowledge graph question answering task, that aims to answer the user's question based on facts over a knowledge graph, on which ours outperforms relevant zero-shot baselines by up to 48% in average, across multiple LLMs of various sizes.",,,
259108266,PandaLM: An Automatic Evaluation Benchmark for LLM Instruction Tuning Optimization,"Instruction tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging task, owing to the complexity of hyperparameter selection and the difficulty involved in evaluating the tuned models. To determine the optimal hyperparameters, an automatic, robust, and reliable evaluation benchmark is essential. However, establishing such a benchmark is not a trivial task due to the challenges associated with evaluation accuracy and privacy protection. In response to these challenges, we introduce a judge large language model, named PandaLM, which is trained to distinguish the superior model given several LLMs. PandaLM's focus extends beyond just the objective correctness of responses, which is the main focus of traditional evaluation datasets. It addresses vital subjective factors such as relative conciseness, clarity, adherence to instructions, comprehensiveness, and formality. To ensure the reliability of PandaLM, we collect a diverse human-annotated test dataset, where all contexts are generated by humans and labels are aligned with human preferences. Our results indicate that PandaLM-7B achieves 93.75% of GPT-3.5's evaluation ability and 88.28% of GPT-4's in terms of F1-score on our test dataset. PandaLM enables the evaluation of LLM to be fairer but with less cost, evidenced by significant improvements achieved by models tuned through PandaLM compared to their counterparts trained with default Alpaca's hyperparameters. In addition, PandaLM does not depend on API-based evaluations, thus avoiding potential data leakage.

259108565,In-Context Learning through the Bayesian Prism,"In-context learning is one of the surprising and useful features of large language models. How it works is an active area of research. Recently, stylized meta-learning-like setups have been devised that train these models on a sequence of input-output pairs (x, f (x)) from a function class using the language modeling loss and observe generalization to unseen functions from the same class. One of the main discoveries in this line of research has been that for several problems such as linear regression, trained transformers learn algorithms for learning functions in context. However, the inductive biases of these models resulting in this behavior are not clearly understood. A model with unlimited training data and compute is a Bayesian predictor: it learns the pretraining distribution. It has been shown that high-capacity transformers mimic the Bayesian predictor for linear regression. In this paper, we show empirical evidence of transformers exhibiting the behavior of this ideal learner across different linear and non-linear function classes. We also extend the previous setups to work in the multitask setting and verify that transformers can do in-context learning in this setup as well and the Bayesian perspective sheds light on this setting also. Finally, via the example of learning Fourier series, we study the inductive bias for in-context learning. We find that in-context learning may or may not have simplicity bias depending on the pretraining data distribution. * Equal Contribution arXiv:2306.04891v1 [cs.LG] 8 Jun 2023 w ∼ N (0 d , I). We are particularly interested in the underdetermined region i.e. k < d. Gaussian prior enables explicit PME computation: both PME and maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution agree and are equal to the minimum L 2 -norm solution of the equations forming the training examples i.e. min w ∥w∥ 2 s.t. w T x i = f (x i ), ∀i ≤ k Standard Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) solvers return the minimum L 2 -norm solution, and thus PME and MAP too, in the underdetermined region i.e. k < d. Skewed-Covariance Regression (F Skew-DR ). This setup is similar to dense-regression, except we assume the following prior on weight vector: w ∼ N (0, Σ), where Σ ∈ R d×d is the covariance matrix with eigenvalues proportional to 1/i 2 , where i ∈ [1, d]. For this prior on w, we can use the same (but more general) argument for dense regression above to obtain the PME and MAP which will be equal and can be obtained by minimizing w T Σ −1 w w.r.t to the constraints w T x i = f (x i ). This setup was motivated by Garg et al. [2022], where it was used to sample x i values for out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation, but not as a prior on w. Sparse Regression (F SR ). In sparse regression, we assume w to be an s-sparse vector in R d i.e. out of its d components only s are non-zero. Following Garg et al. [2022], to sample w for constructing prompts P, we first sample w ∼ N (0 d , I) and then randomly set its d − s components as 0. We consider s = 3 throughout our experiments. While computing the PME appears to be intractable here, the MAP solution can be estimated using Lasso by assuming a Laplacian prior on w Tibshirani [1996].Sign-Vector Regression (F SVR ).Here, we assume w to be a sign vector in {−1, +1} d . For constructing prompts P, we sample d independent Bernoulli random variables b j with a mean of 0.5 and obtain w = [2b 1 − 1, · · · , 2b d − 1] T . While computing the exact PME in this case as well remains intractable, the optimal solution for k > d/2 can be obtained by minimizing the L ∞ norm ∥w∥ ∞ w.r.t. the constraints specified by the input-output examples (w T x i = f (x i )) Mangasarian and Recht [2011]. A specific variation. In general, for the exact recovery of a vector w, the set of all these vectors must satisfy specific convexity conditions Chandrasekaran et al. [2012]. We question if Transformers also require such conditions. To test the same, we define a task F ZR where the convexity conditions are not met and train transformers for regression on this task. Here, w ∈ {z; z | z ∈ {−2, −1, 1, 2} d/2 }, where ; denotes concatenation. Note that the size of this set is 2 d , the same as the size of {−1, 1} d .Low-Rank Regression (F LowRank-DR ).In this case, w is assumed to be a flattened version of a matrix W ∈ R q×q (d = q 2 ) with a rank r, where r ≪ q. A strong baseline, in this case, is to minimize the nuclear norm L * of W i.e. ∥W∥ * subject to constraints w T x i = f (x i ). To sample the rank-r matrix W, we sample A ∼ N (0, 1), s.t. A ∈ R q×r and independently a matrix B of the same shape and distribution, and set W = AB T . Recovery bounds. For each function class above, there is a bound on the minimum number of in-context examples needed for the exact recovery of the solution vector w. The bounds for sparse, sign-vector and low-rank regression are 2s log(d/s) + 5s/4, d/2, and 3r(2q − r) respectively Chandrasekaran et al. [2012].",,,
259108646,ADDP: Learning General Representations for Image Recognition and Generation with Alternating Denoising Diffusion Process,"Image recognition and generation have long been developed independently of each other. With the recent trend towards general-purpose representation learning, the development of general representations for both recognition and generation tasks is also promoted. However, preliminary attempts mainly focus on generation performance, but are still inferior on recognition tasks. These methods are modeled in the vector-quantized (VQ) space, whereas leading recognition methods use pixels as inputs. Our key insights are twofold: (1) pixels as inputs are crucial for recognition tasks; (2) VQ tokens as reconstruction targets are beneficial for generation tasks. These observations motivate us to propose an Alternating Denoising Diffusion Process (ADDP) that integrates these two spaces within a single representation learning framework. In each denoising step, our method first decodes pixels from previous VQ tokens, then generates new VQ tokens from the decoded pixels. The diffusion process gradually masks out a portion of VQ tokens to construct the training samples. The learned representations can be used to generate diverse high-fidelity images and also demonstrate excellent transfer performance on recognition tasks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves competitive performance on unconditional generation, ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and ADE20k segmentation. Importantly, our method represents the first successful development of general representations applicable to both generation and dense recognition tasks. Code shall be released.",,,
259108831,Mixture-of-Domain-Adapters: Decoupling and Injecting Domain Knowledge to Pre-trained Language Models' Memories,"Pre-trained language models (PLMs) demonstrate excellent abilities to understand texts in the generic domain while struggling in a specific domain. Although continued pre-training on a large domain-specific corpus is effective, it is costly to tune all the parameters on the domain. In this paper, we investigate whether we can adapt PLMs both effectively and efficiently by only tuning a few parameters. Specifically, we decouple the feed-forward networks (FFNs) of the Transformer architecture into two parts: the original pre-trained FFNs to maintain the old-domain knowledge and our novel domain-specific adapters to inject domainspecific knowledge in parallel. Then we adopt a mixture-of-adapters gate to fuse the knowledge from different domain adapters dynamically. Our proposed Mixture-of-Domain-Adapters (MixDA) employs a two-stage adapter-tuning strategy that leverages both unlabeled data and labeled data to help the domain adaptation: i) domain-specific adapter on unlabeled data; followed by ii) the task-specific adapter on labeled data. MixDA can be seamlessly plugged into the pretraining-finetuning paradigm and our experiments demonstrate that MixDA achieves superior performance on in-domain tasks (GLUE), out-of-domain tasks (ChemProt, RCT, IMDB, Amazon), and knowledge-intensive tasks (KILT). Further analyses demonstrate the reliability, scalability, and efficiency of our method. 1 Pengcheng He, Xiaodong Liu, Jianfeng Gao, and Weizhu Chen. 2021b.

259129912,Robust Multi-bit Natural Language Watermarking through Invariant Features,"Recent years have witnessed a proliferation of valuable original natural language contents found in subscription-based media outlets, web novel platforms, and outputs of large language models. However, these contents are susceptible to illegal piracy and potential misuse without proper security measures. This calls for a secure watermarking system to guarantee copyright protection through leakage tracing or ownership identification. To effectively combat piracy and protect copyrights, a multi-bit watermarking framework should be able to embed adequate bits of information and extract the watermarks in a robust manner despite possible corruption. In this work, we explore ways to advance both payload and robustness by following a well-known proposition from image watermarking and identify features in natural language that are invariant to minor corruption. Through a systematic analysis of the possible sources of errors, we further propose a corruption-resistant infill model. Our full method improves upon the previous work on robustness by +16.8% point on average on four datasets, three corruption types, and two corruption ratios. 1",,,

However, existing methods usually assume the independence of utterances and model them in isolation. In this paper, we propose a History Semantic Graph Enhanced KBQA model (HSGE) that is able to effectively model long-range semantic dependencies in conversation history while maintaining low computational cost. The framework incorporates a context-aware encoder, which employs a dynamic memory decay mechanism and models context at different levels of granularity. We evaluate HSGE on a widely used benchmark dataset for complex sequential question answering.

259137817,OpenSR: Open-Modality Speech Recognition via Maintaining Multi-Modality Alignment,"Speech Recognition builds a bridge between the multimedia streaming (audio-only, visualonly or audio-visual) and the corresponding text transcription. However, when training the specific model of new domain, it often gets stuck in the lack of new-domain utterances, especially the labeled visual utterances. To break through this restriction, we attempt to achieve zero-shot modality transfer by maintaining the multi-modality alignment in phoneme space learned with unlabeled multimedia utterances in the high resource domain during the pretraining(Shi et al., 2022), and propose a training system Open-modality Speech Recognition (OpenSR) that enables the models trained on a single modality (e.g., audio-only) applicable to more modalities (e.g., visual-only and audio-visual). Furthermore, we employ a cluster-based prompt tuning strategy to handle the domain shift for the scenarios with only common words in the new domain utterances. We demonstrate that OpenSR enables modality transfer from one to any in three different settings (zero-, few-and fullshot), and achieves highly competitive zeroshot performance compared to the existing fewshot and full-shot lip-reading methods. To the best of our knowledge, OpenSR achieves the state-of-the-art performance of word error rate in LRS2 on audio-visual speech recognition and lip-reading with 2.7% and 25.0%, respectively.

However, existing methods solely focus on a single document's coherence patterns, ignoring the underlying correlation between documents. We investigate a GCN-based coherence model that is capable of capturing structural similarities between documents. Our model first creates a graph structure for each document, from where we mine different subgraph patterns. We then construct a heterogeneous graph for the training corpus, connecting documents based on their shared subgraphs. Finally, a GCN is applied to the heterogeneous graph to model the connectivity relationships. We evaluate our method on two tasks, assessing discourse coherence and automated essay scoring. Results show that our GCN-based model outperforms all baselines, achieving a new state-of-the-art on both tasks.",,,
259138821,A Probabilistic Framework for Modular Continual Learning,"Modular approaches, which use a different composition of modules for each problem and avoid forgetting by design, have been shown to be a promising direction in continual learning (CL). However, searching through the large, discrete space of possible module compositions is a challenge because evaluating a composition's performance requires a round of neural network training. To address this challenge, we develop a modular CL framework, called PICLE, that accelerates search by using a probabilistic model to cheaply compute the fitness of each composition. The model combines prior knowledge about good module compositions with datasetspecific information. Its use is complemented by splitting up the search space into subsets, such as perceptual and latent subsets. We show that PICLE is the first modular CL algorithm to achieve different types of transfer while scaling to large search spaces. We evaluate it on two benchmark suites designed to capture different desiderata of CL techniques. On these benchmarks, PICLE offers significantly better performance than state-of-the-art CL baselines.Preprint. Under review.",,,
259165134,Multi-target Backdoor Attacks for Code Pre-trained Models,"Backdoor attacks for neural code models have gained considerable attention due to the advancement of code intelligence. However, most existing works insert triggers into task-specific data for code-related downstream tasks, thereby limiting the scope of attacks. Moreover, the majority of attacks for pre-trained models are designed for understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose task-agnostic backdoor attacks for code pre-trained models. Our backdoored model is pre-trained with two learning strategies (i.e., Poisoned Seq2Seq learning and token representation learning) to support the multitarget attack of downstream code understanding and generation tasks. During the deployment phase, the implanted backdoors in the victim models can be activated by the designed triggers to achieve the targeted attack. We evaluate our approach on two code understanding tasks and three code generation tasks over seven datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can effectively and stealthily attack code-related downstream tasks. Hoi. 2021b.

Rather than merely exploring the breadth of LLM abilities, we believe meticulous and thoughtful designs are essential to thorough, unbiased, and applicable evaluations. Given the importance of world knowledge to LLMs, we construct a Knowledge-oriented LLM Assessment benchmark (KoLA), in which we carefully design three crucial factors: (1) For ability modeling, we mimic human cognition to form a four-level taxonomy of knowledge-related abilities, covering 19 tasks.(2) For data, to ensure fair comparisons, we use both Wikipedia, a corpus prevalently pre-trained by LLMs, along with continuously collected emerging corpora, aiming to evaluate the capacity to handle unseen data and evolving knowledge. (3) For evaluation criteria, we adopt a contrastive system, including overall standard scores for better numerical comparability across tasks and models and a unique self-contrast metric for automatically evaluating knowledge hallucination. We evaluate 21 open-source and commercial LLMs and obtain some intriguing findings. The KoLA dataset and open-participation leaderboard are publicly released at https://kola.xlore.cn and will be continuously updated to provide references for developing LLMs and knowledge-related systems.",,,
259165262,Efficient Backdoor Attacks for Deep Neural Networks in Real-world Scenarios,"Recent deep neural networks (DNNs) have come to rely on vast amounts of training data, providing an opportunity for malicious attackers to exploit and contaminate the data to carry out backdoor attacks. These attacks significantly undermine the reliability of DNNs. However, existing backdoor attack methods make unrealistic assumptions, assuming that all training data comes from a single source and that attackers have full access to the training data. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing a more realistic attack scenario where victims collect data from multiple sources, and attackers cannot access the complete training data. We refer to this scenario as data-constrained backdoor attacks. In such cases, previous attack methods suffer from severe efficiency degradation due to the entanglement between benign and poisoning features during the backdoor injection process.IntroductionDeep neural networks (DNNs) are widely utilized and powerful machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. They excel at learning intricate patterns in data, making them invaluable for various applications such as image recognition[17,21], natural language processing[33,68], image generation[20,30], and anomaly detection[45,64]. However, the effectiveness of DNNs heavily relies on the quantity and quality of the training data. For instance, Stable Diffusion [49], a generative model with 983 million parameters, owes its success in image generation tasks to pre-training on 5 billion image-text pairs.

259165546,World-to-Words: Grounded Open Vocabulary Acquisition through Fast Mapping in Vision-Language Models,"The ability to connect language units to their referents in the physical world, referred to as grounding, is crucial to learning and understanding grounded meanings of words. While humans demonstrate fast mapping in new word learning, it remains unclear whether modern vision-language models can truly represent language with their grounded meanings, and how grounding may further bootstrap new word learning. To this end, we introduce Grounded Open Vocabulary Acquisition (GOVA) to examine grounding and bootstrapping in openworld language learning. As an initial attempt, we propose World-to-Words (W2W), a novel visually-grounded language model by pre-training on image-text pairs highlighting grounding as an objective. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that W2W is a more coherent and fast grounded word learner, and that the grounding ability acquired during pre-training helps the model to learn unseen words more rapidly and robustly.",,,
259203115,A SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE PRUNING APPROACH FOR LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS,"As their size increases, Large Languages Models (LLMs) are natural candidates for network pruning methods: approaches that drop a subset of network weights while striving to preserve performance.Existing methods, however, require either retraining, which is rarely affordable for billion-scale LLMs, or solving a weight reconstruction problem reliant on second-order information, which may also be computationally expensive.In this paper, we introduce a novel, straightforward yet effective pruning method, termed Wanda (Pruning by Weights and activations), designed to induce sparsity in pretrained LLMs.Motivated by the recent observation of emergent large magnitude features in LLMs, our approach prunes weights with the smallest magnitudes multiplied by the corresponding input activations, on a per-output basis.Notably, Wanda requires no retraining or weight update, and the pruned LLM can be used as is.We conduct a thorough evaluation of our method Wanda on LLaMA and LLaMA-2 across various language benchmarks.Wanda significantly outperforms the established baseline of magnitude pruning and performs competitively against recent method involving intensive weight update.Code is available at https://github.com/locuslab/wanda.",,,
259203213,Preserving Commonsense Knowledge from Pre-trained Language Models via Causal Inference,"Fine-tuning has been proven to be a simple and effective technique to transfer the learned knowledge of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks. However, vanilla fine-tuning easily overfits the target data and degrades the generalization ability. Most existing studies attribute it to catastrophic forgetting, and they retain the pre-trained knowledge indiscriminately without identifying what knowledge is transferable. Motivated by this, we frame fine-tuning into a causal graph and discover that the crux of catastrophic forgetting lies in the missing causal effects from the pretrained data. Based on the causal view, we propose a unified objective for fine-tuning to retrieve the causality back. Intriguingly, the unified objective can be seen as the sum of the vanilla fine-tuning objective, which learns new knowledge from target data, and the causal objective, which preserves old knowledge from PLMs. Therefore, our method is flexible and can mitigate negative transfer while preserving knowledge. Since endowing models with commonsense is a long-standing challenge, we implement our method on commonsense QA with a proposed heuristic estimation to verify its effectiveness. In the experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods on all six commonsense QA datasets and can be implemented as a plug-in module to inflate the performance of existing QA models. for Computational Linguistics. . 2020.

259203325,GIO: GRADIENT INFORMATION OPTIMIZATION FOR TRAINING DATASET SELECTION,"It is often advantageous to train models on a subset of the available train examples, because the examples are of variable quality or because one would like to train with fewer examples, without sacrificing performance. We present Gradient Information Optimization (GIO), a scalable, task-agnostic approach to this data selection problem that requires only a small set of (unlabeled) examples representing a target distribution. GIO begins from a natural, information-theoretic objective that is intractable in practice. Our contribution is in showing that it can be made highly scalable through a simple relaxation of the objective and a highly efficient implementation. In experiments with machine translation, spelling correction, and image recognition, we show that GIO delivers outstanding results with very small train sets. These findings are robust to different representation models and hyperparameters for GIO itself. GIO is task-and domain-agnostic and can be applied out-of-the-box to new datasets and domains.Active learning. Active learning methods (e.g. Sener and Savarese, 2018; Gal et al., 2017; Kirsch  et al., 2019)  can be cast as data selection methods in our sense. In active learning, one iteratively chooses new unlabeled training examples to label, with the goal of efficiently creating a powerful train set. By contrast, GIO makes no use of labels and is oriented towards the goal of identifying a subset of existing cases to use for training. Additionally, active learning is most suited to classification problems, whereas GIO works with any arbitrary task.Heuristic. GIO is closer to recent methods in which one uses a large language model to generate a large number of candidate texts and then extracts a subset of them based on a specific criteria. For example, Brown et al. (2020) develop a heuristic method to filter CommonCrawl based on a trained classifier's probability that datapoints are high quality. Similarly, Wenzek et al. (2020) develop a pipeline to clean CommonCrawl based principally on the perplexity of an LM trained on high quality text, and Xie et al. (2023) develop a sampling technique based on approximate n-gram counts.Like GIO, these heuristic methods aim to select a subset of data that is higher quality and more relevant. However, they are either highly tailored to their particular tasks or they require very large numbers of examples (to develop classifiers or construct target probabilities). By contrast, GIO is task-and domain-agnostic, it can be applied plug-and-play to a new task and dataset, and it requires comparatively few gold examples X to serve as the target distribution.Similarity Search. Methods using vector or n-gram similarity search can also be used for data selection at scale (e.g. Johnson et al., 2017;Bernhardsson, 2017;Santhanam et al., 2022). The technique would index G and X and retrieve the top-k datapoints from G for each point in X. Like our method, similarity search works in a continuous space. However, similarity search can be prone to selecting suboptimal points; we review such a case in detail in Section 3.4. Additionally, similarity search does not have a natural stopping criterion and requires data size to be chosen arbitrarily. Is 10% data enough? 20%? We don't know a priori. And if the data in G is far away from X, similarity search will still choose it up to the desired data size. Recently, Yao et al. (2022) use a BM25 retrieval method for data selection, with strong results. However, BM25 operates on a bag-of-words model, which can make it challenging when the target set is small, and like any similarity search, requires data size to be chosen arbitrarily beforehand. Further, this method only applies to text tasks, whereas GIO applies to any task with continuous representation.",,,
259203396,MIR-GAN: Refining Frame-Level Modality-Invariant Representations with Adversarial Network for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition,"Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) attracts a surge of research interest recently by leveraging multimodal signals to understand human speech. Mainstream approaches addressing this task have developed sophisticated architectures and techniques for multi-modality fusion and representation learning. However, the natural heterogeneity of different modalities causes distribution gap between their representations, making it challenging to fuse them. In this paper, we aim to learn the shared representations across modalities to bridge their gap. Different from existing similar methods on other multimodal tasks like sentiment analysis, we focus on the temporal contextual dependencies considering the sequence-to-sequence task setting of AVSR. In particular, we propose an adversarial network to refine framelevel modality-invariant representations (MIR-GAN), which captures the commonality across modalities to ease the subsequent multimodal fusion process. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks LRS3 and LRS2 show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts 1 . Pingchuan Ma, Stavros Petridis, and Maja Pantic. 2021.

Generative Grammar suggests that humans generate natural language texts by learning language grammar. We propose a syntax-guided generation schema, which generates the sequence guided by a constituency parse tree in a topdown direction. The decoding process can be decomposed into two parts: (1) predicting the infilling texts for each constituent in the lexicalized syntax context given the source sentence;(2) mapping and expanding each constituent to construct the next-level syntax context. Accordingly, we propose a structural beam search method to find possible syntax structures hierarchically. Experiments on paraphrase generation and machine translation show that the proposed method outperforms autoregressive baselines, while also demonstrating effectiveness in terms of interpretability, controllability, and diversity.",,,
259224350,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 HARNESSING MIXED OFFLINE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING DATASETS VIA TRAJECTORY WEIGHTING,"Most offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms return a target policy maximizing a trade-off between (1) the expected performance gain over the behavior policy that collected the dataset, and (2) the risk stemming from the out-of-distributionness of the induced state-action occupancy. It follows that the performance of the target policy is strongly related to the performance of the behavior policy and, thus, the trajectory return distribution of the dataset. We show that in mixed datasets consisting of mostly low-return trajectories and minor high-return trajectories, stateof-the-art offline RL algorithms are overly restrained by low-return trajectories and fail to exploit high-performing trajectories to the fullest. To overcome this issue, we show that, in deterministic MDPs with stochastic initial states, the dataset sampling can be re-weighted to induce an artificial dataset whose behavior policy has a higher return. This re-weighted sampling strategy may be combined with any offline RL algorithm. We further analyze that the opportunity for performance improvement over the behavior policy correlates with the positive-sided variance of the returns of the trajectories in the dataset. We empirically show that while CQL, IQL, and TD3+BC achieve only a part of this potential policy improvement, these same algorithms combined with our reweighted sampling strategy fully exploit the dataset. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that, despite its theoretical limitation, the approach may still be efficient in stochastic environments.

259262427,DSRM: Boost Textual Adversarial Training with Distribution Shift Risk Minimization,"Adversarial training is one of the bestperforming methods in improving the robustness of deep language models. However, robust models come at the cost of high time consumption, as they require multi-step gradient ascents or word substitutions to obtain adversarial samples. In addition, these generated samples are deficient in grammatical quality and semantic consistency, which impairs the effectiveness of adversarial training. To address these problems, we introduce a novel, effective procedure for instead adversarial training with only clean data. Our procedure, distribution shift risk minimization (DSRM), estimates the adversarial loss by perturbing the input data's probability distribution rather than their embeddings. This formulation results in a robust model that minimizes the expected global loss under adversarial attacks. Our approach requires zero adversarial samples for training and reduces time consumption by up to 70% compared to current best-performing adversarial training methods. Experiments demonstrate that DSRM considerably improves BERT's resistance to textual adversarial attacks and achieves state-of-the-art robust accuracy on various benchmarks.",,,
259286910,DialoGPS: Dialogue Path Sampling in Continuous Semantic Space for Data Augmentation in Multi-Turn Conversations,"In open-domain dialogue generation tasks, contexts and responses in most datasets are one-to-one mapped, violating an important many-to-many characteristic: a context leads to various responses, and a response answers multiple contexts. Without such patterns, models poorly generalize and prefer responding safely. Many attempts have been made in either multi-turn settings from a one-to-many perspective or in a many-to-many perspective but limited to single-turn settings. The major challenge to many-to-many augment multiturn dialogues is that discretely replacing each turn with semantic similarity breaks fragile context coherence. In this paper, we propose DialoGue Path Sampling (DialoGPS) method in continuous semantic space, the first manyto-many augmentation method for multi-turn dialogues. Specifically, we map a dialogue to our extended Brownian Bridge, a special Gaussian process. We sample latent variables to form coherent dialogue paths in the continuous space. A dialogue path corresponds to a new multi-turn dialogue and is used as augmented training data. We show the effect of DialoGPS with both automatic and human evaluation.",,,
259287121,SRL: Scaling Distributed Reinforcement Learning to Over Ten Thousand Cores,"The ever-growing complexity of reinforcement learning (RL) tasks demands a distributed RL system to efficiently generate and process a massive amount of data to train intelligent agents. However, existing open-source libraries suffer from various limitations, which impede their practical use in challenging scenarios where largescale training is necessary. While industrial systems from OpenAI and DeepMind have achieved successful large-scale RL training, their system architecture and implementation details remain undisclosed to the community. In this paper, we present a novel system abstraction on the dataflows of RL training, which unifies practical RL training across diverse applications into a general and flexible framework and enables fine-grained system-level optimizations. Following this abstraction, we develop a scalable, efficient, and extensible distributed RL system called ReaLly Scalable RL (SRL). The system architecture of SRL separates major RL computation components and allows massively parallelized training. We also introduce a collection of techniques to further optimize the system performance. Moreover, SRL offers user-friendly and extensible interfaces, which facilitate the development of customized algorithms. Our evaluation shows that SRL outperforms existing academic libraries in both a single machine and a medium-sized cluster. In a large-scale cluster, the novel architecture of SRL leads to up to 3.7x speedup compared to the design choices adopted by the existing libraries. We also conduct a direct benchmark comparison to Ope-nAI's industrial system, Rapid [5], in the challenging hide-and-seek environment[2]. SRL reproduces the same solution as reported by OpenAI with up to 5x speedup in wall-clock time. Furthermore, we also examine the performance of SRL in a much harder variant of the hide-and-seek environment and achieve substantial learning speedup by scaling SRL to over 15k CPU cores and 32 A100 GPUs. * Equal contribution.Notably, SRL is the first in the academic community to perform RL experiments at such a large scale.",,,
259298238,KwikBucks: Correlation Clustering with Cheap-Weak and Expensive-Strong Signals,"For text clustering, there is often a dilemma: one can either first embed each examples independently and then compute pair-wise similarities based on the embeddings, or use a crossattention model that takes a pair of examples as input and produces a similarity. The former is more scalable but the similarities often have lower quality, whereas the latter does not scale well but produces higher quality similarities. We address this dilemma by developing a clustering algorithm that leverages the best of both worlds: the scalability of former and the quality of the latter. We formulate the problem of text clustering with embeddingbased and cross-attention models as a novel version of the Budgeted Correlation Clustering problem (BCC) where along with a limited number of queries to an expensive oracle (a cross-attention model in our case), we have unlimited access to a cheaper but less accurate second oracle (embedding similarities in our case). We develop a theoretically motivated algorithm that leverages the cheap oracle to judiciously query the strong oracle while maintaining high clustering quality. We empirically demonstrate gains in query minimization and clustering metrics on a variety of datasets with diverse strong and cheap oracles.",,,
259342096,Mixture-of-Experts Meets Instruction Tuning: A Winning Combination for Large Language Models,"Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a neural architecture design that can be utilized to add learnable parameters to Large Language Models (LLMs) without increasing inference cost. Instruction tuning is a technique for training LLMs to follow instructions. We advocate combining these two approaches, as we find that MoE models benefit more from instruction tuning than dense models. In particular, we conduct empirical studies across three experimental setups: (i) Direct finetuning on individual downstream tasks devoid of instruction tuning; (ii) Instruction tuning followed by in-context few-shot or zero-shot generalization on downstream tasks; and (iii) Instruction tuning supplemented by further finetuning on individual downstream tasks. In the first scenario, MoE models overall underperform dense models of identical computational capacity. This narrative, however, dramatically changes with the introduction of instruction tuning (second and third scenario), used independently or in conjunction with task-specific finetuning. Our most powerful model, FLAN-MOE 32B , surpasses the performance of FLAN-PALM 62B on four benchmark tasks, while using only a third of the FLOPs. The advancements embodied by FLAN-MOE inspire a reevaluation of the design principles of large-scale, high-performance language models in the framework of task-agnostic learning. * Work done at Google Preprint. Under review. arXiv:2305.14705v2 [cs.CL] 5 Jul 2023 2.2 Instruction Fine-tuning RecipeWe fine-tune FLAN-MOE using the prefix language model objective on the FLAN collective dataset[4,28]. Each FLAN-MOE will inherit the auxiliary loss setting during pre-training. All the model parameters will be updated. We adapt the sequence length of each FLAN-MOE to 2, 048 for input and 512 for output based on the relative position embedding. The dropout rate is 0.05 and the expert dropout rate is 0.2. The learning rate is 1e −4 . The optimizer setting follows [4].ExperimentWe study FLAN-MOE in the context of instruction-tuning. We first perform a controlled comparison of FLAN-MOE to an equivalent ""standard"" dense encoder-decoder Transformer (T5), across a range of model sizes in Section 3.2. We subsequently demonstrate in Section 3.3 that scaling up our model, referred to as FLAN-MOE, can attain remarkable performance levels. Our most extensive model, FLAN-ST 32B , surpasses the performance of FLAN-PALM 62B while utilizing less than 30% of FLOPs per token. We further ablate the various design decisions in the next Section. 3.1 Settings Traning Data. By default, all models are trained on the 1,836 finetuning tasks by combining four mixtures from prior work: Muffin, T0-SF, NIV2, and CoT, as in [4]. Specifically, Muffin comprises 80 tasks from [52] and 26 dialog/program synthesis tasks; T0-SF comprises 193 tasks from [44]; NIV2 comprises 1554 tasks from [51]; CoT comprises 9 reasoning tasks.Evaluations. We conduct both zero-shot and few-shot evaluations on held-out tasks as in [4] which were not included as part of the finetuning data.

259342823,CAME: Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization,"Adaptive gradient methods, such as Adam and LAMB, have demonstrated excellent performance in the training of large language models. Nevertheless, the need for adaptivity requires maintaining second-moment estimates of the per-parameter gradients, which entails a high cost of extra memory overheads. To solve this problem, several memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., Adafactor) have been proposed to obtain a drastic reduction in auxiliary memory usage, but with a performance penalty. In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose CAME to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks such as BERT and GPT-2 training. Notably, for BERT pre-training on the large batch size of 32,768, our proposed optimizer attains faster convergence and higher accuracy compared with the Adam optimizer. The implementation of CAME is publicly available 1 .",,,
259360414,Your spouse needs professional help: Determining the Contextual Appropriateness of Messages through Modeling Social Relationships,"Understanding interpersonal communication requires, in part, understanding the social context and norms in which a message is said. However, current methods for identifying offensive content in such communication largely operate independent of context, with only a few approaches considering community norms or prior conversation as context. Here, we introduce a new approach to identifying inappropriate communication by explicitly modeling the social relationship between the individuals. We introduce a new dataset of contextually-situated judgments of appropriateness and show that large language models can readily incorporate relationship information to accurately identify appropriateness in a given context. Using data from online conversations and movie dialogues, we provide insight into how the relationships themselves function as implicit norms and quantify the degree to which context-sensitivity is needed in different conversation settings. Further, we also demonstrate that contextualappropriateness judgments are predictive of other social factors expressed in language such as condescension and politeness.",,,
259360601,Sample-Efficient Learning of POMDPs with Multiple Observations In Hindsight,"This paper studies the sample-efficiency of learning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), a challenging problem in reinforcement learning that is known to be exponentially hard in the worst-case. Motivated by real-world settings such as loading in game playing, we propose an enhanced feedback model called ""multiple observations in hindsight"", where after each episode of interaction with the POMDP, the learner may collect multiple additional observations emitted from the encountered latent states, but may not observe the latent states themselves. We show that sample-efficient learning under this feedback model is possible for two new subclasses of POMDPs: multi-observation revealing POMDPs and distinguishable POMDPs. Both subclasses generalize and substantially relax revealing POMDPs-a widely studied subclass for which sample-efficient learning is possible under standard trajectory feedback. Notably, distinguishable POMDPs only require the emission distributions from different latent states to be different instead of linearly independent as required in revealing POMDPs. * Fudan University.",,,
259370520,ETHICIST: Targeted Training Data Extraction Through Loss Smoothed Soft Prompting and Calibrated Confidence Estimation,"Large pre-trained language models achieve impressive results across many tasks. However, recent works point out that pre-trained language models may memorize a considerable fraction of their training data, leading to the privacy risk of information leakage. In this paper, we propose a method named ETHICIST for targeted training data Extraction THrough loss smoothed soft prompting and calIbrated ConfIdence eSTimation, investigating how to recover the suffix in the training data when given a prefix. To elicit memorization in the attacked model, we tune soft prompt embeddings while keeping the model fixed. We further propose a smoothing loss that smooths the loss distribution of the suffix tokens to make it easier to sample the correct suffix. In order to select the most probable suffix from a collection of sampled suffixes and estimate the prediction confidence, we propose a calibrated confidence estimation method, which normalizes the confidence of the generated suffixes with a local estimation. We show that ETHICIST significantly improves the extraction performance on a recently proposed public benchmark. We also investigate several factors influencing the data extraction performance, including decoding strategy, model scale, prefix length, and suffix length.

In this work, we present CLPM (Cross-lingual Prototype Masking), a dynamic and token-wise masking scheme, for multilingual pre-training, using a special token [C] x to replace a random token x in the input sentence.[C] x is a cross-lingual prototype for x and then forms an explicit crosslingual forward pass. We instantiate CLPM for the multilingual pre-training phase of UNMT (unsupervised neural machine translation), and experiments show that CLPM can consistently improve the performance of UNMT models on {De, Ro, N e} ↔ En. Beyond UNMT or bilingual tasks, we show that CLPM can consistently improve the performance of multilingual models on cross-lingual classification.",,,
259370539,RADE: Reference-Assisted Dialogue Evaluation for Open-Domain Dialogue,"Evaluating open-domain dialogue systems is challenging for reasons such as the one-tomany problem, i.e., many appropriate responses other than just the golden response. As of now, automatic evaluation methods need better consistency with humans, while reliable human evaluation can be time-and cost-intensive. To this end, we propose the Reference-Assisted Dialogue Evaluation (RADE) approach under the multi-task learning framework, which leverages the pre-created utterance as reference other than the gold response to relief the one-tomany problem. Specifically, RADE explicitly compares reference and the candidate response to predict their overall scores. Moreover, an auxiliary response generation task enhances prediction via a shared encoder. To support RADE, we extend three datasets with additional rated responses other than just a golden response by human annotation. Experiments on our three datasets and two existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlations with human evaluation outperform stateof-the-art baselines.Satanjeev Banerjee and Alon Lavie. 2005.

The proposed methods are implemented progressively on two German SL corpora containing gloss annotations. Multilingual NMT combined with data augmentation appear to be the most successful setting, yielding statistically significant improvements as measured by three automatic metrics (up to over 6 points BLEU), and confirmed via human evaluation.

Current AMR metrics are all based on nodes or triples matching without considering the entire structures of AMR graphs. To address this problem, and inspired by learned similarity evaluation on plain text, we propose AMRSim, an automatic AMR graph similarity evaluation metric. To overcome the high cost of collecting human-annotated data, AMRSim automatically generates silver AMR graphs and utilizes self-supervised learning methods. We evaluated AMRSim on various datasets and found that AMRSim significantly improves the correlations with human semantic scores and remains robust under diverse challenges. We also discuss how AMRSim can be extended to multilingual cases. 1",,,
259370588,Revisiting Cross-Lingual Summarization: A Corpus-based Study and A New Benchmark with Improved Annotation,"Most existing cross-lingual summarization (CLS) work constructs CLS corpora by simply and directly translating pre-annotated summaries from one language to another, which can contain errors from both summarization and translation processes. To address this issue, we propose ConvSumX, a cross-lingual conversation summarization benchmark, through a new annotation schema that explicitly considers source input context. ConvSumX consists of 2 sub-tasks under different real-world scenarios, with each covering 3 language directions. We conduct thorough analysis on ConvSumX and 3 widely-used manually annotated CLS corpora and empirically find that ConvSumX is more faithful towards input text. Additionally, based on the same intuition, we propose a 2-Step method, which takes both conversation and summary as input to simulate human annotation process. Experimental results show that 2-Step method surpasses strong baselines on ConvSumX under both automatic and human evaluation. Analysis shows that both source input text and summary are crucial for modeling cross-lingual summaries.",,,

We propose a novel sampling approach to mine topics for the purpose of metric evaluation, and conduct the analysis via three large corpora showing that certain automated coherence metrics are correlated. Moreover, we extend the analysis to measure topical differences between corpora. Lastly, we examine the reliability of human judgement by conducting an extensive user study, which is designed as an amalgamation of different proxy tasks to derive a finer insight into the human decision-making processes. Our findings reveal some correlation between automated coherence metrics and human judgement, especially for generic corpora.",,,
259370602,Peer-Label Assisted Hierarchical Text Classification,"Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is a challenging task, in which the labels of texts can be organized into a category hierarchy. To deal with the HTC problem, many existing works focus on utilizing the parent-child relationships that are explicitly shown in the hierarchy. However, texts with a category hierarchy also have some latent relevancy among labels in the same level of the hierarchy. We refer to these labels as peer labels, from which the peer effects are originally utilized in our work to improve the classification performance. To fully explore the peer-label relationship, we develop a PeerHTC method. This method innovatively measures the latent relevancy of peer labels through several metrics and then encodes the relevancy with a Graph Convolutional Neural Network. We also propose a sample importance learning method to ameliorate the side effects raised by modelling the peer label relevancy. Our experiments on several standard datasets demonstrate the evidence of peer labels and the superiority of PeerHTC over other state-of-the-art HTC methods in terms of classification accuracy.",,,
259370630,Open-ended Long Text Generation via Masked Language Modeling,"Pre-trained autoregressive (AR) language models such as BART and GPTs have dominated Open-ended Long Text Generation (Open-LTG). However, the AR nature will decrease the inference efficiency along with the increase of generation length, which hinder their application in Open-LTG. To improve inference efficiency, we alternatively explore the potential of the pre-trained masked language models (MLMs) along with a representative iterative non-autoregressive (NAR) decoding strategy for Open-LTG. Our preliminary study shows that pre-trained MLMs can merely generate short text and will collapse for long text modeling. To enhance the long text generation capability of MLMs, we introduce two simple yet effective strategies for the iterative NAR model: dynamic sliding window attention (DSWA) and linear temperature decay (LTD). It can alleviate long-distance collapse problems and achieve longer text generation with a flexible trade-off between performance and inference speedup. Experiments on the storytelling and multi-paragraph opinionated article writing tasks show that pre-trained MLMs can achieve more than 3 × → 13 × speedup with better performance than strong AR models.

Existing works have incorporated contextual information to better learn the representation of political actors for specific tasks through graph models. However, they are limited to the structure and objective of training settings and can not be generalized to all politicians and other tasks. In this paper, we propose a Unified Pre-training Architecture for Political Actor Modeling based on language (UPPAM). In UPPAM, we aggregate statements to represent political actors and learn the mapping from languages to representation, instead of learning the representation of particular persons. We further design structureaware contrastive learning and behavior-driven contrastive learning tasks, to inject multidimensional information in the political context into the mapping. In this framework, we can profile political actors from different aspects and solve various downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and capability of generalization of our method. * Corresponding author.",,,
259370644,Answering Ambiguous Questions via Iterative Prompting,"In open-domain question answering, due to the ambiguity of questions, multiple plausible answers may exist. To provide feasible answers to an ambiguous question, one approach is to directly predict all valid answers, but this can struggle with balancing relevance and diversity. An alternative is to gather candidate answers and aggregate them, but this method can be computationally costly and may neglect dependencies among answers. In this paper, we present AmbigPrompt to address the imperfections of existing approaches to answering ambiguous questions. Specifically, we integrate an answering model with a prompting model in an iterative manner. The prompting model adaptively tracks the reading process and progressively triggers the answering model to compose distinct and relevant answers. Additionally, we develop a task-specific postpretraining approach for both the answering model and the prompting model, which greatly improves the performance of our framework. Empirical studies on two commonly-used open benchmarks show that AmbigPrompt achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results while using less memory and having a lower inference latency than competing approaches. Additionally, AmbigPrompt also performs well in low-resource settings. The code are available at: https://github. com/sunnweiwei/AmbigPrompt.",,,

Existing methods usually assume that entities and their mentions are identified beforehand, which falls short of real-world applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose TAG, a novel tableto-graph generation model for joint extraction of entities and relations at document-level. To enhance the learning of task dependencies, TAG induces a latent graph among mentions, with different types of edges indicating different task information, which is further broadcast with a relational graph convolutional network. To alleviate the error propagation problem, we adapt the hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm to back-propagate task information at decoding stage.

259370656,Dual Class Knowledge Propagation Network for Multi-label Few-shot Intent Detection,"Multi-label intent detection aims to assign multiple labels to utterances and attracts increasing attention as a practical task in task-oriented dialogue systems. As dialogue domains change rapidly and new intents emerge fast, the lack of annotated data motivates multi-label few-shot intent detection. However, previous studies are confused by the identical representation of the utterance with multiple labels and overlook the intrinsic intra-class and inter-class interactions. To address these two limitations, we propose a novel dual class knowledge propagation network in this paper. In order to learn well-separated representations for utterances with multiple intents, we first introduce a labelsemantic augmentation module incorporating class name information. For better consideration of the inherent intra-class and inter-class relations, an instance-level and a class-level graph neural network are constructed, which not only propagate label information but also propagate feature structure. And we use a simple yet effective method to predict the intent count of each utterance.

Sentiment expression varies depending on the domain, and it is necessary to create domain-specific datasets.While socially important, TSC in the news domain remains relatively understudied. We introduce MAD-TSC, the first multilingual aligned dataset designed for TSC in news. MAD-TSC differs substantially from existing resources. First, it includes aligned examples in eight languages to facilitate a comparison of performance for individual languages, and a direct comparison of human and machine translation. Second, the dataset is sampled from a diversified parallel news corpus, and is diversified in terms of news sources and geographic spread of entities. Finally, MAD-TSC is more challenging than existing datasets because its samples are more complex. We exemplify the use of MAD-TSC with comprehensive monolingual and multilingual experiments. The latter shows that machine translations can successfully replace manual ones, and that performance for all included languages can match that of English by automatically translating test examples.",,,

Indeed, supporting arguments with narratives or personal experiences (henceforth, stories) is a very natural thing to do -and yet, this phenomenon is largely unexplored in computational argumentation. Which role do stories play in an argument? Do they make the argument more effective? What are their narrative properties? To address these questions, we collected and annotated StoryARG, a dataset sampled from well-established corpora in computational argumentation (ChangeMyView and RegulationRoom), and the Social Sciences (Europolis), as well as comments to New York Times articles. StoryARG contains 2451 textual spans annotated at two levels. At the argumentative level, we annotate the function of the story (e.g., clarification, disclosure of harm, search for a solution, establishing speaker's authority), as well as its impact on the effectiveness of the argument and its emotional load. At the level of narrative properties, we annotate whether the story has a plot-like development, is factual or hypothetical, and who the protagonist is.What makes a story effective in an argument?

However, presenting the same news headline to all readers is a suboptimal strategy, because it does not take into account the different preferences and interests of diverse readers, who may be confused about why a particular article has been recommended to them and do not see a clear connection between their interests and the recommended article. In this paper, we present a novel framework that addresses these challenges by incorporating user profiling to generate personalized headlines, and a combination of automated and human evaluation methods to determine user preference for personalized headlines. Our framework utilizes a learnable relevance function to assign personalized signature phrases to users based on their reading histories, which are then used to personalize headline generation. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in generating personalized headlines that meet the needs of a diverse audience.

Unfortunately, existing techniques assume that each link, node, and attribute prediction is independent, and fall short of predicting the appearance of new nodes that were not observed in the past. In this paper, we address two interrelated questions; (1) can we exploit task interdependence to improve prediction accuracy? and(2)can we predict new nodes with their attributes? We propose a unified framework that predicts node attributes and topology changes such as the appearance and disappearance of links and the emergence and loss of nodes. This framework comprises components for independent and interactive prediction and for predicting new nodes. Our experimental study using realworld data confirms that our interdependent prediction framework achieves higher accuracy than methods based on independent prediction.",,,

However, we currently lack a large-scale benchmark that captures user↔assistant interactions with all of the aforementioned features. To this end, we propose SIMMC-VR, an extension of the SIMMC 2.0 dataset to a video-grounded taskoriented dialog dataset that captures real-world AI-assisted user scenarios in VR. We propose a novel data collection paradigm that involves (1) generating object-centric multimodal dialog flows with egocentric visual streams and visually-grounded templates, and (2) manually paraphrasing the simulated dialogs for naturalness and diversity while preserving multimodal dependencies. To measure meaningful progress in the field, we propose four tasks to address the new challenges in SIMMC-VR, which require complex spatial-temporal dialog reasoning in active egocentric scenes. We benchmark the proposed tasks with strong multimodal models, and highlight the key capabilities that current models lack for future research directions. * Work done during an internship at Meta Reality Labs.",,,
259370722,Unsupervised Melody-to-Lyric Generation,"Automatic melody-to-lyric generation is a task in which song lyrics are generated to go with a given melody. It is of significant practical interest and more challenging than unconstrained lyric generation as the music imposes additional constraints onto the lyrics. The training data is limited as most songs are copyrighted, resulting in models that underfit the complicated cross-modal relationship between melody and lyrics. In this work, we propose a method for generating high-quality lyrics without training on any aligned melody-lyric data. Specifically, we design a hierarchical lyric generation framework that first generates a song outline and second the complete lyrics. The framework enables disentanglement of training (based purely on text) from inference (melodyguided text generation) to circumvent the shortage of parallel data.We leverage the segmentation and rhythm alignment between melody and lyrics to compile the given melody into decoding constraints as guidance during inference. The two-step hierarchical design also enables content control via the lyric outline, a much-desired feature for democratizing collaborative song creation. Experimental results show that our model can generate high-quality lyrics that are more on-topic, singable, intelligible, and coherent than strong baselines, for example SongMASS (Sheng et al., 2021), a SOTA model trained on a parallel dataset, with a 24% relative overall quality improvement based on human ratings. 1",,,

In previous studies, attribute extraction is generally treated as a classification problem for predicting attribute types or a sequence tagging problem for labeling attribute values, where two paradigms, i.e., closed-world and open-world assumption, are involved. However, both of these paradigms have limitations in terms of real-world applications. And prior studies attempting to integrate these paradigms through ensemble, pipeline, and co-training models, still face challenges like cascading errors, high computational overhead, and difficulty in training. To address these existing problems, this paper presents Attribute Tree, a unified formulation for realworld attribute extraction application, where closed-world, open-world, and semi-open attribute extraction tasks are modeled uniformly. Then a text-to-tree generation model, AtTGen, is proposed to learn annotations from different scenarios efficiently and consistently. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed paradigm well covers various scenarios for real-world applications, and the model achieves state-ofthe-art, outperforming existing methods by a large margin on three datasets.

259370752,Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification for Selective Text Classification in Ambiguous Tasks,"Many text classification tasks are inherently ambiguous, which results in automatic systems having a high risk of making mistakes, in spite of using advanced machine learning models. For example, toxicity detection in usergenerated content is a subjective task, and notions of toxicity can be annotated according to a variety of definitions that can be in conflict with one another. Instead of relying solely on automatic solutions, moderation of the most difficult and ambiguous cases can be delegated to human workers. Potential mistakes in automated classification can be identified by using uncertainty estimation (UE) techniques. Although UE is a rapidly growing field within natural language processing, we find that stateof-the-art UE methods estimate only epistemic uncertainty and show poor performance, or under-perform trivial methods for ambiguous tasks such as toxicity detection. We argue that in order to create robust uncertainty estimation methods for ambiguous tasks it is necessary to account also for aleatoric uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a new uncertainty estimation method that combines epistemic and aleatoric UE methods. We show that by using our hybrid method, we can outperform state-of-the-art UE methods for toxicity detection and other ambiguous text classification tasks 1 .",,,
259370776,Composition-contrastive Learning for Sentence Embeddings,"Vector representations of natural language are ubiquitous in search applications. Recently, various methods based on contrastive learning have been proposed to learn textual representations from unlabelled data; by maximizing alignment between minimally-perturbed embeddings of the same text, and encouraging a uniform distribution of embeddings across a broader corpus. Differently, we propose maximizing alignment between texts and a composition of their phrasal constituents. We consider several realizations of this objective and elaborate the impact on representations in each case. Experimental results on semantic textual similarity tasks show improvements over baselines that are comparable with state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, this work is the first to do so without incurring costs in auxiliary training objectives or additional network parameters. 1",,,
259370780,FiD-ICL: A Fusion-in-Decoder Approach for Efficient In-Context Learning,"Large pre-trained models are capable of fewshot in-context learning (ICL), i.e., performing a new task by prepending a few demonstrations before the test input. However, the concatenated demonstrations are often excessively long and induce additional computation. Inspired by fusion-in-decoder (FiD) models which efficiently aggregate more passages and thus outperforms concatenation-based models in opendomain QA, we hypothesize that similar techniques can be applied to improve the efficiency and end-task performance of ICL. To verify this, we present a comprehensive study on applying three fusion methods-concatenationbased (early fusion), FiD (intermediate), and ensemble-based (late)-to ICL. We adopt a meta-learning setup where a model is first trained to perform ICL on a mixture of tasks using one selected fusion method, then evaluated on held-out tasks for ICL. Results on 11 heldout tasks show that FiD-ICL matches or outperforms the other two fusion methods. Additionally, we show that FiD-ICL (1) is 10x faster at inference time compared to concat-based and ensemble-based ICL, as we can easily precompute the representations of in-context examples and reuse them; (2) enables scaling up to meta-training 3B-sized models, which would fail for concat-based ICL.",,,
259370785,Test-time Adaptation for Machine Translation Evaluation by Uncertainty Minimization,"The neural metrics recently received considerable attention from the research community in the automatic evaluation of machine translation. Unlike text-based metrics that have interpretable and consistent evaluation mechanisms for various data sources, the reliability of neural metrics in assessing out-of-distribution data remains a concern due to the disparity between training data and real-world data. This paper aims to address the inference bias of neural metrics through uncertainty minimization during test time, without requiring additional data. Our proposed method comprises three steps: uncertainty estimation, test-time adaptation, and inference. Specifically, the model employs the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during test time and subsequently refine the prediction through optimization. To validate our approach, we apply the proposed method to three representative models and conduct experiments on the WMT21 benchmarks. The results obtained from both in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluations consistently demonstrate improvements in correlation performance across different models. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the proposed method effectively reduces model uncertainty. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/NLP2CT/TaU.",,,
259370787,Local Interpretation of Transformer Based on Linear Decomposition,"In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. However, limitations in interpretability have hindered their applications in the real world. This work proposes to interpret neural networks by linear decomposition and finds that the ReLU-activated Transformer can be considered as a linear model on a single input. We further leverage the linearity of the model and propose a linear decomposition of the model output to generate local explanations. Our evaluation of sentiment classification and machine translation shows that our method achieves competitive performance in efficiency and fidelity of explanation. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of our approach in applications with examples of error analysis on multiple tasks. 1 * Corresponding author. 1  We release our algorithm toolkit at https://github. com/DoubleVII/pydec.",,,
259370790,A Facial Expression-Aware Multimodal Multi-task Learning Framework for Emotion Recognition in Multi-party Conversations,"Multimodal Emotion Recognition inMultiparty Conversations (MERMC)has recently attracted considerable attention. Due to the complexity of visual scenes in multi-party conversations, most previous MERMC studies mainly focus on text and audio modalities while ignoring visual information. Recently, several works proposed to extract face sequences as visual features and have shown the importance of visual information in MERMC. However, given an utterance, the face sequence extracted by previous methods may contain multiple people's faces, which will inevitably introduce noise to the emotion prediction of the real speaker. To tackle this issue, we propose a two-stage framework named Facial expressionaware Multimodal Multi-Task learning (Fa-cialMMT). Specifically, a pipeline method is first designed to extract the face sequence of the real speaker of each utterance, which consists of multimodal face recognition, unsupervised face clustering, and face matching. With the extracted face sequences, we propose a multimodal facial expression-aware emotion recognition model, which leverages the frame-level facial emotion distributions to help improve utterance-level emotion recognition based on multi-task learning. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FacialMMT framework on the benchmark MELD dataset. The source code is publicly released at https: //github.com/NUSTM/FacialMMT.",,,
259370799,TemplateGEC: Improving Grammatical Error Correction with Detection Template,"Grammatical error correction (GEC) can be divided into sequence-to-edit (Seq2Edit) and sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) frameworks, both of which have their pros and cons. To utilize the strengths and make up for the shortcomings of these frameworks, this paper proposes a novel method, TemplateGEC, which capitalizes on the capabilities of both Seq2Edit and Seq2Seq frameworks in error detection and correction respectively. TemplateGEC utilizes the detection labels from a Seq2Edit model, to construct the template as the input. A Seq2Seq model is employed to enforce consistency between the predictions of different templates by utilizing consistency learning. Experimental results on the Chinese NLPCC18, English BEA19 and CoNLL14 benchmarks show the effectiveness and robustness of TemplateGEC. Further analysis reveals the potential of our method in performing human-in-the-loop GEC.",,,
259370800,Cross-Domain Data Augmentation with Domain-Adaptive Language Modeling for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Cross-domain Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) aims to leverage the useful knowledge from a source domain to identify aspectsentiment pairs in sentences from a target domain. To tackle the task, several recent works explore a new unsupervised domain adaptation framework, i.e., Cross-Domain Data Augmentation (CDDA), aiming to directly generate much labeled target-domain data based on the labeled source-domain data. However, these CDDA methods still suffer from several issues: 1) preserving many source-specific attributes such as syntactic structures; 2) lack of fluency and coherence; 3) limiting the diversity of generated data. To address these issues, we propose a new cross-domain Data Augmentation approach based on Domain-Adaptive Language Modeling named DA 2 LM, which contains three stages: 1) assigning pseudo labels to unlabeled target-domain data; 2) unifying the process of token generation and labeling with a Domain-Adaptive Language Model (DALM) to learn the shared context and annotation across domains; 3) using the trained DALM to generate labeled target-domain data. Experiments show that DA 2 LM consistently outperforms previous feature adaptation and CDDA methods on both ABSA and Aspect Extraction tasks.

259370815,CoAD: Automatic Diagnosis through Symptom and Disease Collaborative Generation,"Automatic diagnosis (AD), a critical application of AI in healthcare, employs machine learning techniques to assist doctors in gathering patient symptom information for precise disease diagnosis. The Transformer-based method utilizes an input symptom sequence, predicts itself through auto-regression, and employs the hidden state of the final symptom to determine the disease. Despite its simplicity and superior performance demonstrated, a decline in disease diagnosis accuracy is observed caused by 1) a mismatch between symptoms observed during training and generation, and 2) the effect of different symptom orders on disease prediction. To address the above obstacles, we introduce the CoAD, a novel disease and symptom collaborative generation framework, which incorporates several key innovations to improve AD: 1) aligning sentence-level disease labels with multiple possible symptom inquiry steps to bridge the gap between training and generation; 2) expanding symptom labels for each sub-sequence of symptoms to enhance annotation and eliminate the effect of symptom order; 3) developing a repeated symptom input schema to effectively and efficiently learn the expanded disease and symptom labels. We evaluate the CoAD framework using four datasets, including three public and one private, and demonstrate that it achieves an average 2.3% improvement over previous state-of-theart results in automatic disease diagnosis. For reproducibility, we release the code and data at https://github.com/KwanWaiChung/coad.",,,

Compared with previous methods, we emphasize the importance of not caching history tasks' data, which makes the problem more challenging. Our proposed method applies the parameter isolation strategy. For each task, it allocates a small portion of private parameters and learns them with a shared pre-trained model. To load correct parameters at testing time, we introduce a simple yet effective non-parametric method. Experiments on continual language learning benchmarks show that our method is significantly better than all existing no-data-cache methods, and is comparable (or even better) than those using historical data 1 . . 2021a.

259370833,WhitenedCSE: Whitening-based Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings,"This paper presents a whitening-based contrastive learning method for sentence embedding learning (WhitenedCSE), which combines contrastive learning with a novel shuffled group whitening. Generally, contrastive learning pulls distortions of a single sample (i.e., positive samples) close and push negative samples far away, correspondingly facilitating the alignment and uniformity in the feature space. A popular alternative to the ""pushing"" operation is whitening the feature space, which scatters all the samples for uniformity. Since the whitening and the contrastive learning have large redundancy w.r.t. the uniformity, they are usually used separately and do not easily work together. For the first time, this paper integrates whitening into the contrastive learning scheme and facilitates two benefits. 1) Better uniformity. We find that these two approaches are not totally redundant but actually have some complementarity due to different uniformity mechanism. 2) Better alignment. We randomly divide the feature into multiple groups along the channel axis and perform whitening independently within each group. By shuffling the group division, we derive multiple distortions of a single sample and thus increase the positive sample diversity. Consequently, using multiple positive samples with enhanced diversity further improves contrastive learning due to better alignment. Extensive experiments on seven semantic textual similarity tasks show our method achieves consistent improvement over the contrastive learning baseline and sets new states of the art, e.g., 78.78% (+2.53% based on BERT base ) Spearman correlation on STS tasks. 1",,,
259370836,DIP: Dead code Insertion based Black-box Attack for Programming Language Model,"Automatic processing of source code, such as code clone detection and software vulnerability detection, is very helpful to software engineers. Large pre-trained Programming Language (PL) models (such as CodeBERT, Graph-CodeBERT, CodeT5, etc.), show very powerful performance on these tasks. However, these PL models are vulnerable to adversarial examples that are generated with slight perturbation. Unlike natural language, an adversarial example of code must be semantic-preserving and compilable. Due to the requirements, it is hard to directly apply the existing attack methods for natural language models. In this paper, we propose DIP (Dead code Insertion based Blackbox Attack for Programming Language Model), a high-performance and efficient black-box attack method to generate adversarial examples using dead code insertion. We evaluate our proposed method on 9 victim downstream-task large code models. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box attack in both attack efficiency and attack quality, while generated adversarial examples are compiled preserving semantic functionality.",,,

Although social scientists recognize moral expression as domain specific, there are no systematic methods for analyzing whether a text classifier learns the domain-specific expression of moral language or not. We propose Tomea, a method to compare a supervised classifier's representation of moral rhetoric across domains. Tomea enables quantitative and qualitative comparisons of moral rhetoric via an interpretable exploration of similarities and differences across moral concepts and domains.

Solving such a linguistic construction is not a trivial issue in natural language processing since it involves the retrieval of non-overtly expressed verbal material, which might in turn require the model to integrate human-like syntactic and semantic knowledge. In this paper, we explored the issue of how the prototypicality of event participants affects the ability of Language Models (LMs) to handle elliptical sentences, and to identify the omitted arguments at different degrees of thematic fit, ranging from highly typical participants to semantically anomalous ones. With this purpose in mind, we built ELLie, the first dataset composed entirely of utterances containing different types of elliptical constructions, and structurally suited for evaluating the effect of argument thematic fit in solving ellipsis and reconstructing the missing element. Our tests demonstrated that the probability scores assigned by the models are higher for typical events than for atypical and impossible ones in different elliptical contexts, confirming the influence of prototypicality of the event participants in interpreting such linguistic structures. Finally, we conducted a retrieval task of the elided verb in the sentence in which the low performance of LMs highlighted a considerable difficulty in reconstructing the correct event.",,,

Existing defenses focus on improving the robustness of the victim model in the training stage. However, they often neglect to proactively mitigate adversarial attacks during inference. Towards this overlooked aspect, we propose a defense framework that aims to mitigate attacks by confusing attackers and correcting adversarial contexts that are caused by malicious perturbations. Our framework comprises three components: (1) a synonym-based transformation to randomly corrupt adversarial contexts in the word level, (2) a developed BERT defender to correct abnormal contexts in the representation level, and (3) a simple detection method to filter out adversarial examples, any of which can be flexibly combined. Additionally, our framework helps improve the robustness of the victim model during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in defending against word-level adversarial attacks.",,,
259375870,Teaching Arithmetic to Small Transformers,"Large language models like GPT-4 exhibit emergent capabilities across generalpurpose tasks, such as basic arithmetic, when trained on extensive text data, even though these tasks are not explicitly encoded by the unsupervised, next-token prediction objective. This study investigates how small transformers, trained from random initialization, can efficiently learn arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, and elementary functions like square root, using the nexttoken prediction objective. We first demonstrate that conventional training data is not the most effective for arithmetic learning, and simple formatting changes can significantly improve accuracy. This leads to sharp phase transitions as a function of training data scale, which, in some cases, can be explained through connections to low-rank matrix completion. Building on prior work, we then train on chain-of-thought style data that includes intermediate step results. Even in the complete absence of pretraining, this approach significantly and simultaneously improves accuracy, sample complexity, and convergence speed. We also study the interplay between arithmetic and text data during training and examine the effects of few-shot prompting, pretraining, and model scale. Additionally, we discuss length generalization challenges. Our work highlights the importance of high-quality, instructive data that considers the particular characteristics of the next-word prediction objective for rapidly eliciting arithmetic capabilities. 2 * Authors contributed equally to this paper. 2 Our code is available at https://github.com/lee-ny/teaching_arithmetic Preprint.

On the other hand, end-to-end knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) models output responses grounded in facts, but they still struggle with complex reasoning, such as comparison or ordinal questions. In this paper, we propose a new method for complex question answering where we combine a knowledge graph retriever based on an end-to-end KGQA model with a language model that reasons over the retrieved facts to return an answer. We observe that augmenting language model prompts with retrieved KG facts improves performance over using a language model alone by an average of 83%.

259841489,MARTINGALE POSTERIOR NEURAL PROCESSES,"A Neural Process (NP) estimates a stochastic process implicitly defined with neural networks given a stream of data, rather than pre-specifying priors already known, such as Gaussian processes. An ideal NP would learn everything from data without any inductive biases, but in practice, we often restrict the class of stochastic processes for the ease of estimation. One such restriction is the use of a finite-dimensional latent variable accounting for the uncertainty in the functions drawn from NPs. Some recent works show that this can be improved with more ""data-driven"" source of uncertainty such as bootstrapping. In this work, we take a different approach based on the martingale posterior, a recently developed alternative to Bayesian inference. For the martingale posterior, instead of specifying prior-likelihood pairs, a predictive distribution for future data is specified. Under specific conditions on the predictive distribution, it can be shown that the uncertainty in the generated future data actually corresponds to the uncertainty of the implicitly defined Bayesian posteriors. Based on this result, instead of assuming any form of the latent variables, we equip a NP with a predictive distribution implicitly defined with neural networks and use the corresponding martingale posteriors as the source of uncertainty. The resulting model, which we name as Martingale Posterior Neural Process (MPNP), is demonstrated to outperform baselines on various tasks.",,,
259847777,SAN: INDUCING METRIZABILITY OF GAN WITH DISCRIMINATIVE NORMALIZED LINEAR LAYER,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) learn a target probability distribution by optimizing a generator and a discriminator with minimax objectives. This paper addresses the question of whether such optimization actually provides the generator with gradients that make its distribution close to the target distribution. We derive metrizable conditions, sufficient conditions for the discriminator to serve as the distance between the distributions by connecting the GAN formulation with the concept of sliced optimal transport. Furthermore, by leveraging these theoretical results, we propose a novel GAN training scheme, called slicing adversarial network (SAN). With only simple modifications, a broad class of existing GANs can be converted to SANs. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets support our theoretical results and the SAN's effectiveness as compared to usual GANs. Furthermore, we also apply SAN to StyleGAN-XL, which leads to state-of-the-art FID score amongst GANs for class conditional generation on ImageNet 256×256. arXiv:2301.12811v3 [cs.LG] 6 Sep 2023 Preprint Table 1: Common GAN losses do not simultaneously satisfy all the sufficient conditions given in Theorem 5.3. Thus, we propose the SAN to address one of the conditions, direction optimality. Even if a direction ω is the maximizer of the inner problems V, it does not satisfy direction optimality except in Wasserstein GAN (see Sec. 6). The results in Appx. E empirically demonstrate that a discriminator trained on Wasserstein GAN tends not to satisfy separability. The last condition of injectivity depends on the discriminator implementation (see Appx. E for empirical verification). Direction optimality Separability Injectivity Wassertein GAN ✓ weak * GAN (Hinge, Saturating, Non-saturating) ✗ ✓ * SAN (Hinge, Saturating, Non-saturating) ✓ ✓ *In this paper, we provide a novel perspective on GAN optimization, which helps us to consider whether a discriminator is metrizable. Definition 1.1 (Metrizable discriminator). Let µ θ and µ 0 be measures. Given an objective function J (θ; ·) for θ, a discriminator f is (J , D)or J -metrizable for µ θ and µ 0 , if J (θ; f ) is minimized only with θ ∈ arg min θ D(µ 0 , µ θ ) for a certain distance on measures, D(·, ·).To evaluate the dissimilarity with a given GAN minimization problem J , we are interested in other conditions besides the discriminator's optimality. Hence, we propose metrizable conditions, namely, direction optimality, separability, and injectivity, that induce J -metrizable discriminator. To achieve this, we first introduce a divergence, called functional mean divergence (FM * ), in Sec. 3. We connect the FM * with the minimization objective function of Wasserstein GAN. Then, we obtain the metrizable conditions for Wasserstein GAN by investigating Question 1.2. We provide an answer to this question in Sec. 4 by relating the FM * to the concept of sliced optimal transport(Bonneel et al., 2015;Kolouri et al., 2019). Then, in Sec. 5, we formalize the proposed conditions for Wasserstein GAN and further extend the result to generic GAN. Question 1.2. Under what conditions is FM * a distance?Based on the derived metrizable conditions, we propose the Slicing Adversarial Network (SAN) in Sec. 6. As seen inTable 1, we find that optimal discriminators for most existing GANs do not satisfy direction optimality. Hence, we develop a modification scheme for GAN maximization problems to enforce direction optimality on our discriminator. Owing to the scheme's simplicity, GANs can easily be converted to SANs. We conduct experiments to verify our perspective and demonstrate that SANs are superior to GANs in certain generation tasks on synthetic and image datasets. In particular, we confirmed a SAN improves state-of-the-art FID for conditional generation with StyleGAN-XL (Sauer et al., 2022) on ImageNet 256×256 despite the simple modifications.",,,

259977321,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 DEXDEFORM: DEXTEROUS DEFORMABLE OBJECT MANIPULATION WITH HUMAN DEMONSTRATIONS AND DIFFERENTIABLE PHYSICS,"In this work, we aim to learn dexterous manipulation of deformable objects using multi-fingered hands. Reinforcement learning approaches for dexterous rigid object manipulation would struggle in this setting due to the complexity of physics interaction with deformable objects. At the same time, previous trajectory optimization approaches with differentiable physics for deformable manipulation would suffer from local optima caused by the explosion of contact modes from hand-object interactions. To address these challenges, we propose DexDeform, a principled framework that abstracts dexterous manipulation skills from human demonstration, and refines the learned skills with differentiable physics. Concretely, we first collect a small set of human demonstrations using teleoperation. And we then train a skill model using demonstrations for planning over action abstractions in imagination. To explore the goal space, we further apply augmentations to the existing deformable shapes in demonstrations and use a gradient optimizer to refine the actions planned by the skill model. Finally, we adopt the refined trajectories as new demonstrations for finetuning the skill model. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce a suite of six challenging dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks.

260063238,Knowledge-Augmented Language Model Prompting for Zero-Shot Knowledge Graph Question Answering,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of performing zero-shot closed-book question answering tasks, based on their internal knowledge stored in parameters during pre-training. However, such internalized knowledge might be insufficient and incorrect, which could lead LLMs to generate factually wrong answers. Furthermore, fine-tuning LLMs to update their knowledge is expensive. To this end, we propose to augment the knowledge directly in the input of LLMs. Specifically, we first retrieve the relevant facts to the input question from the knowledge graph based on semantic similarities between the question and its associated facts. After that, we prepend the retrieved facts to the input question in the form of the prompt, which is then forwarded to LLMs to generate the answer. Our framework, Knowledge-Augmented language model PromptING (KAP-ING), requires no model training, thus completely zero-shot. We validate the performance of our KAPING framework on the knowledge graph question answering task, that aims to answer the user's question based on facts over a knowledge graph, on which ours outperforms relevant zero-shot baselines by up to 48% in average, across multiple LLMs of various sizes.",,,

We consider a training dataset with well-separated input vectors: Any pair of input data with the same label are positively correlated, and any pair with different labels are negatively correlated. Our analysis shows that, during the early phase of training, neurons in the first layer try to align with either the positive data or the negative data, depending on its corresponding weight on the second layer. A careful analysis of the neurons' directional dynamics allows us to provide an O( log n √ µ ) upper bound on the time it takes for all neurons to achieve good alignment with the input data, where n is the number of data points and µ measures how well the data are separated. After the early alignment phase, the loss converges to zero at a O( 1 t ) rate, and the weight matrix on the first layer is approximately low-rank. Numerical experiments on the MNIST dataset illustrate our theoretical findings.",,,
260154786,Submodular Reinforcement Learning,"In reinforcement learning (RL), rewards of states are typically considered additive, and following the Markov assumption, they are independent of states visited previously. In many important applications, such as coverage control, experiment design and informative path planning, rewards naturally have diminishing returns, i.e., their value decreases in light of similar states visited previously. To tackle this, we propose submodular RL (SUBRL), a paradigm which seeks to optimize more general, non-additive (and history-dependent) rewards modelled via submodular set functions which capture diminishing returns. Unfortunately, in general, even in tabular settings, we show that the resulting optimization problem is hard to approximate. On the other hand, motivated by the success of greedy algorithms in classical submodular optimization, we propose SUBPO, a simple policy gradient-based algorithm for SUBRL that handles non-additive rewards by greedily maximizing marginal gains. Indeed, under some assumptions on the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP), SUBPO recovers optimal constant factor approximations of submodular bandits. Moreover, we derive a natural policy gradient approach for locally optimizing SUBRL instances even in large state-and action-spaces. We showcase the versatility of our approach by applying SUBPO to several applications such as biodiversity monitoring, Bayesian experiment design, informative path planning, and coverage maximization. Our results demonstrate sample efficiency, as well as scalability to high-dimensional state-action spaces.",,,

While it is difficult to measure whether neural program synthesis methods have similar capabilities, we can measure whether they compositionally generalize, that is, whether a model that has been trained on the simpler subtasks is subsequently able to solve more complex tasks. In this paper, we characterize several different forms of compositional generalization that are desirable in program synthesis, forming a meta-benchmark which we use to create generalization tasks for two popular datasets, RobustFill and DeepCoder. We then propose ExeDec, a novel decomposition-based synthesis strategy that predicts execution subgoals to solve problems step-by-step informed by program execution at each step.

In stochastic optimization, such as training neural networks, folklore suggests that momentum may help deep learning optimization by reducing the variance of the stochastic gradient update, but previous theoretical analyses do not find momentum to offer any provable acceleration. Theoretical results in this paper clarify the role of momentum in stochastic settings where the learning rate is small and gradient noise is the dominant source of instability, suggesting that SGD with and without momentum behave similarly in the short and long time horizons. Experiments show that momentum indeed has limited benefits for both optimization and generalization in practical training regimes where the optimal learning rate is not very large, including small-to medium-batch training from scratch on ImageNet and finetuning language models on downstream tasks.Preprint.

We name our algorithm Patch-DM, in which a new feature collage strategy is designed to avoid the boundary artifact when synthesizing large-size images. Feature collage systematically crops and combines partial features of the neighboring patches to predict the features of a shifted image patch, allowing the seamless generation of the entire image due to the overlap in the patch feature space. Patch-DM produces high-quality image synthesis results on our newly collected dataset of nature images (1024×512), as well as on standard benchmarks of smaller sizes (256×256), including LSUN-Bedroom, LSUN-Church, and FFHQ. We compare our method with previous patch-based generation methods * Equal Contribution. and achieve state-of-the-art FID scores on all four datasets.

260378993,From Sparse to Soft Mixtures of Experts,"Sparse mixture of expert architectures (MoEs) scale model capacity without large increases in training or inference costs. Despite their success, MoEs suffer from a number of issues: training instability, token dropping, inability to scale the number of experts, or ineffective finetuning. In this work, we propose Soft MoE, a fully-differentiable sparse Transformer that addresses these challenges, while maintaining the benefits of MoEs. Soft MoE performs an implicit soft assignment by passing different weighted combinations of all input tokens to each expert. As in other MoE works, experts in Soft MoE only process a subset of the (combined) tokens, enabling larger model capacity at lower inference cost. In the context of visual recognition, Soft MoE greatly outperforms standard Transformers (ViTs) and popular MoE variants (Tokens Choice and Experts Choice). For example, Soft MoE-Base/16 requires 10.5× lower inference cost (5.7× lower wall-clock time) than ViT-Huge/14 while matching its performance after similar training. Soft MoE also scales well: Soft MoE Huge/14 with 128 experts in 16 MoE layers has over 40× more parameters than ViT Huge/14, while inference time cost grows by only 2%, and it performs substantially better. * Equal contribution.

260683028,PARL: A Unified Framework for Policy Alignment in Reinforcement Learning,"We present a novel unified bilevel optimization-based framework, PARL, formulated to address the recently highlighted critical issue of policy alignment in reinforcement learning using utility or preferencebased feedback.We identify a major gap within current algorithmic designs for solving policy alignment due to a lack of precise characterization of the dependence of the alignment objective on the data generated by policy trajectories.This shortfall contributes to the sub-optimal performance observed in contemporary algorithms.Our framework addressed these concerns by explicitly parameterizing the distribution of the upper alignment objective (reward design) by the lower optimal variable (optimal policy for the designed reward).Interestingly, from an optimization perspective, our formulation leads to a new class of stochastic bilevel problems where the stochasticity at the upper objective depends upon the lower-level variable.To demonstrate the efficacy of our formulation in resolving alignment issues in RL, we devised an algorithm named A-PARL to solve PARL problem, establishing sample complexity bounds of order O(1/T ).Our empirical results substantiate that the proposed PARL can address the alignment concerns in RL by showing significant improvements (up to 63% in terms of required samples) for policy alignment in large-scale environments of the Deepmind control suite and Meta world tasks.",,,

First, you need to get a job inside the bank, this will give you access to the … Figure 1: Engaging in conversations with ChatGPT using ciphers can lead to unsafe behaviors. ABSTRACT Safety lies at the core of the development of Large Language Models (LLMs).There is ample work on aligning LLMs with human ethics and preferences, including data filtering in pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and red teaming, etc. In this study, we discover that chat in cipher can bypass the safety alignment techniques of LLMs, which are mainly conducted in natural languages. We propose a novel framework CipherChat to systematically examine the generalizability of safety alignment to non-natural languages -ciphers. CipherChat enables humans to chat with LLMs through cipher prompts topped with system role descriptions and few-shot enciphered demonstrations. We use CipherChat to assess state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 for different representative human ciphers across 11 safety domains in both English and Chinese. Experimental results show that certain ciphers succeed almost 100% of the time to bypass the safety alignment of GPT-4 in several safety domains, demonstrating the necessity of developing safety alignment for non-natural languages.Notably, we identify that LLMs seem to have a ""secret cipher"", and propose a novel SelfCipher that uses only role play and several demonstrations in natural language to evoke this capability. SelfCipher surprisingly outperforms existing human ciphers in almost all cases. 1",,,
261076339,POSE MODULATED AVATARS FROM VIDEO,"It is now possible to reconstruct dynamic human motion and shape from a sparse set of cameras using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) driven by an underlying skeleton. However, a challenge remains to model the deformation of cloth and skin in relation to skeleton pose. Unlike existing avatar models that are learned implicitly or rely on a proxy surface, our approach is motivated by the observation that different poses necessitate unique frequency assignments. Neglecting this distinction yields noisy artifacts in smooth areas or blurs fine-grained texture and shape details in sharp regions. We develop a two-branch neural network that is adaptive and explicit in the frequency domain. The first branch is a graph neural network that models correlations among body parts locally, taking skeleton pose as input. The second branch combines these correlation features to a set of global frequencies and then modulates the feature encoding. Our experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of preserving details and generalization capabilities.",,,
261100891,Prediction without Preclusion: Recourse Verification with Reachable Sets,"Machine learning models are often used to decide who will receive a loan, a job interview, or a public benefit. Standard techniques to build these models use features about people but overlook their actionability. In turn, models can assign predictions that are fixed -meaning that consumers who are denied loans, interviews, or benefits may be permanently locked out from access to credit, employment, or assistance. In this work, we introduce a formal testing procedure to flag models that assign fixed predictions that we call recourse verification. We develop machinery to reliably determine if a given model can provide recourse to its decision subjects from a set of user-specified actionability constraints. We demonstrate how our tools can ensure recourse and adversarial robustness in real-world datasets and use them to study the infeasibility of recourse in real-world lending datasets. Our results highlight how models can inadvertently assign fixed predictions that permanently bar access, and we provide tools to design algorithms that account for actionability when developing models. arXiv:2308.12820v1 [cs.LG] 24 Aug 2023 2. We develop fast algorithms to delineate reachable sets from complex actionability constraints. Our algorithms can be used to ensure that a model can provide recourse in model development or deployment, and are designed to abstain when they are unable to certify recourse in order to avoid incorrect outputs.3. We present an empirical study of the infeasibility of recourse using several real-world datasets, realistic actionability constraints, and common model classes. Our results illustrate the prevalence of predictions without recourse in lending applications, and highlight pitfalls in flagging these examples with recourse provision. Finally, we demonstrate how our methods can be used to ensure recourse in consumer-facing applications like lending and content moderation.Related Work This work opens a new direction for research on algorithmic recourse, which studies how to change the prediction of a given model through actions in a feature space[73,75]. Much work on recourse develops methods for recourse provision -i.e., methods to provide a person with an action to change the prediction of a given model or, relatedly, counterfactual explanations -i.e., methods that explain a model's decision by showing what actions would change it [see e.g., 35, 18, 59, 42, 76, 77, 66, 38]. We focus instead on verification of models in terms of recourse feasibility -i.e., testing if a model assigns predictions that a given person can change using any feasible action. The need for verification arises because algorithmic recourse may be infeasible under realistic actionability constraints. Although actionability is a defining characteristic of recourse [see e.g., 75], the fact that such constraints may lead to infeasibility is not well-known in the literature. The exceptions [73, 43, 16] mention infeasibility but do not study it in detail. In contrast to the lack of attention in the literature, we show that recourse infeasibility is pervasive and is completely missed by most of the existing methods for recourse provision.",,,
261276856,ELUCIDATING THE EXPOSURE BIAS IN DIFFUSION MODELS,"Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities, but their exposure bias problem, described as the input mismatch between training and sampling, lacks in-depth exploration.In this paper, we systematically investigate the exposure bias problem in diffusion models by first analytically modelling the sampling distribution, based on which we then attribute the prediction error at each sampling step as the root cause of the exposure bias issue.Furthermore, we discuss potential solutions to this issue and propose an intuitive metric for it.Along with the elucidation of exposure bias, we propose a simple, yet effective, training-free method called Epsilon Scaling to alleviate the exposure bias.We show that Epsilon Scaling explicitly moves the sampling trajectory closer to the vector field learned in the training phase by scaling down the network output (Epsilon), mitigating the input mismatch between training and sampling.Experiments on various diffusion frameworks (ADM, DDPM/DDIM, EDM, LDM), unconditional and conditional settings, and deterministic vs. stochastic sampling verify the effectiveness of our method.Remarkably, our ADM-ES, as a SOTA stochastic sampler, obtains 2.17 FID on CIFAR-10 under 100-step unconditional generation.The code is available at https://github.com/forever208/ADM-ESand https://github.com/forever208/EDM-ESWe point out that the exposure bias problem in diffusion models lacks in-depth exploration.For example, there is no proper metric to quantify the exposure bias and no explicit error analysis for it.To shed light on exposure bias, we conduct a systematical investigation in this paper by first",,,
261530996,On Penalty Methods for Nonconvex Bilevel Optimization and First-Order Stochastic Approximation,"In this work, we study first-order algorithms for solving Bilevel Optimization (BO) where the objective functions are smooth but possibly nonconvex in both levels and the variables are restricted to closed convex sets. As a first step, we study the landscape of BO through the lens of penalty methods, in which the upper-and lower-level objectives are combined in a weighted sum with penalty parameter σ > 0. In particular, we establish a strong connection between the penalty function and the hyper-objective by explicitly characterizing the conditions under which the values and derivatives of the two must be O(σ)-close. A by-product of our analysis is the explicit formula for the gradient of hyper-objective when the lower-level problem has multiple solutions under minimal conditions, which could be of independent interest. Next, viewing the penalty formulation as O(σ)-approximation of the original BO, we propose firstorder algorithms that find an ϵ-stationary solution by optimizing the penalty formulation with σ = O(ϵ). When the perturbed lower-level problem uniformly satisfies the small-error proximal error-bound (EB) condition, we propose a first-order algorithm that converges to an ϵ-stationary point of the penalty function, using in total O(ϵ −3 ) and O(ϵ −7 ) accesses to first-order (stochastic) gradient oracles when the oracle is deterministic and oracles are noisy, respectively. Under an additional assumption on stochastic oracles, we show that the algorithm can be implemented in a fully single-loop manner, i.e., with O(1) samples per iteration, and achieves the improved oracle-complexity of O(ϵ −3 ) and O(ϵ −5 ), respectively.",,,
261557296,PROMPTTTS 2: DESCRIBING AND GENERATING VOICES WITH TEXT PROMPT,"Speech conveys more information than text, as the same word can be uttered in various voices to convey diverse information. Compared to traditional text-to-speech (TTS) methods relying on speech prompts (reference speech) for voice variability, using text prompts (descriptions) is more user-friendly since speech prompts can be hard to find or may not exist at all. TTS approaches based on the text prompt face two main challenges: 1) the one-to-many problem, where not all details about voice variability can be described in the text prompt, and 2) the limited availability of text prompt datasets, where vendors and large cost of data labeling are required to write text prompts for speech. In this work, we introduce PromptTTS 2 to address these challenges with a variation network to provide variability information of voice not captured by text prompts, and a prompt generation pipeline to utilize the large language models (LLM) to compose high quality text prompts. Specifically, the variation network predicts the representation extracted from the reference speech (which contains full information about voice variability) based on the text prompt representation. For the prompt generation pipeline, it generates text prompts for speech with a speech language understanding model to recognize voice attributes (e.g., gender, speed) from speech and a large language model to formulate text prompts based on the recognition results. Experiments on a large-scale (44K hours) speech dataset demonstrate that compared to the previous works, PromptTTS 2 generates voices more consistent with text prompts and supports the sampling of diverse voice variability, thereby offering users more choices on voice generation.",,,
261582259,RELAY DIFFUSION: UNIFYING DIFFUSION PROCESS ACROSS RESOLUTIONS FOR IMAGE SYNTHESIS,"Diffusion models achieved great success in image synthesis, but still face challenges in high-resolution generation. Through the lens of discrete cosine transformation, we find the main reason is that the same noise level on a higher resolution results in a higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio in the frequency domain. In this work, we present Relay Diffusion Model (RDM), which transfers a low-resolution image or noise into an equivalent high-resolution one for diffusion model via blurring diffusion and block noise. Therefore, the diffusion process can continue seamlessly in any new resolution or model without restarting from pure noise or lowresolution conditioning. RDM achieves state-of-the-art FID on CelebA-HQ and sFID on ImageNet 256×256, surpassing previous works such as ADM, LDM and DiT by a large margin.

However, challenges still exist in the training of diffusion models for high-resolution images. More specifically, there are two main obstacles:Training Efficiency. Although equipped with UNet to balance the memory and computation cost across different resolutions, diffusion models still require a large amount of resources to train on high-resolution images. One popular solution is to train the diffusion model on a latent (usually 4× compression rate in resolution) space and map the result back as pixels(Rombach et al., 2022), which is fast but inevitably suffers from some low-level artifacts. The cascaded method  trains a series of varying-size super-resolution diffusion models, which is effective but needs a complete sampling for each stage separately.Noise Schedule. Diffusion models need a noise schedule to control the amount of the isotropic Gaussian noise at each step. The setting of the noise schedule shows great influence over the performance, and most current models follow the linear (Ho et al., 2020) or cosine  schedule. However, an ideal noise schedule should be resolution-dependent (SeeFigure 2or Chen (2023)), resulting in suboptimal performance to train high-resolution models directly with common schedules designed for resolutions of 32×32 or 64×64 pixels.",,,
261682321,UNIFIED LANGUAGE-VISION PRETRAINING IN LLM WITH DYNAMIC DISCRETE VISUAL TOKENIZATION,"Recently, the remarkable advance of the Large Language Model (LLM) has inspired researchers to transfer its extraordinary reasoning capability to both vision and language data. However, the prevailing approaches primarily regard the visual input as a prompt and focus exclusively on optimizing the text generation process conditioned upon vision content by a frozen LLM. Such an inequitable treatment of vision and language heavily constrains the model's potential. In this paper, we break through this limitation by representing both vision and language in a unified form. Specifically, we introduce a well-designed visual tokenizer to translate the non-linguistic image into a sequence of discrete tokens like a foreign language that LLM can read. The resulting visual tokens encompass high-level semantics worthy of a word and also support dynamic sequence length varying from the image. Coped with this tokenizer, the presented foundation model called LaVIT can handle both image and text indiscriminately under the same generative learning paradigm. This unification empowers LaVIT to serve as an impressive generalist interface to understand and generate multi-modal content simultaneously. Extensive experiments further showcase that it outperforms the existing models by a large margin on massive vision-language tasks.

262054014,UNDERSTANDING CATASTROPHIC FORGETTING IN LANGUAGE MODELS VIA IMPLICIT INFERENCE,"Fine-tuning (via methods such as instruction-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback) is a crucial step in training language models to robustly carry out tasks of interest.However, we lack a systematic understanding of the effects of fine-tuning, particularly on tasks outside the narrow fine-tuning distribution.In a simplified scenario, we demonstrate that improving performance on tasks within the fine-tuning data distribution comes at the expense of suppressing model capabilities on other tasks.This degradation is especially pronounced for tasks ""closest"" to the fine-tuning distribution.We hypothesize that language models implicitly infer the task of the prompt corresponds, and the fine-tuning process predominantly skews this task inference towards tasks in the fine-tuning distribution.To test this hypothesis, we propose Conjugate Prompting to see if we can recover pretrained capabilities.Conjugate prompting artificially makes the task look farther from the fine-tuning distribution while requiring the same capability.We find that conjugate prompting systematically recovers some of the pretraining capabilities on our synthetic setup.We then apply conjugate prompting to real-world LLMs using the observation that fine-tuning distributions are typically heavily skewed towards English.We find that simply translating the prompts to different languages can cause the fine-tuned models to respond like their pretrained counterparts instead.This allows us to recover the in-context learning abilities lost via instruction tuning, and more concerningly, to recover harmful content generation suppressed by safety fine-tuning in chatbots like ChatGPT.",,,

262944419,Identifying the Risks of LM Agents with an LM-Emulated Sandbox,"Recent advances in Language Model (LM) agents and tool use, exemplified by applications like ChatGPT Plugins, enable a rich set of capabilities but also amplify potential risks-such as leaking private data or causing financial losses. Identifying these risks is labor-intensive, necessitating implementing the tools, setting up the environment for each test scenario manually, and finding risky cases. As tools and agents become more complex, the high cost of testing these agents will make it increasingly difficult to find high-stakes, long-tail risks. To address these challenges, we introduce ToolEmu: a framework that uses a LM to emulate tool execution and enables scalable testing of LM agents against a diverse range of tools and scenarios. Alongside the emulator, we develop an LM-based automatic safety evaluator that examines agent failures and quantifies associated risks. We test both the tool emulator and evaluator through human evaluation and find that 68.8% of failures identified with ToolEmu would be valid real-world agent failures. Using our curated initial benchmark consisting of 36 high-stakes tools and 144 test cases, we provide a quantitative risk analysis of current LM agents and identify numerous failures with potentially severe outcomes. Notably, even the safest LM agent exhibits such failures 23.9% of the time according to our evaluator, underscoring the need to develop safer LM agents for real-world deployment. 1 * Equal contribution.

263152829,HOW TO CATCH AN AI LIAR: LIE DETECTION IN BLACK-BOX LLMS BY ASKING UNRELATED QUESTIONS,"Large language models (LLMs) can ""lie"", which we define as outputting false statements despite ""knowing"" the truth in a demonstrable sense.LLMs might ""lie"", for example, when instructed to output misinformation.Here, we develop a simple lie detector that requires neither access to the LLM's activations (black-box) nor ground-truth knowledge of the fact in question.The detector works by asking a predefined set of unrelated follow-up questions after a suspected lie, and feeding the LLM's yes/no answers into a logistic regression classifier.Despite its simplicity, this lie detector is highly accurate and surprisingly general.When trained on examples from a single setting-prompting GPT-3.5 to lie about factual questionsthe detector generalises out-of-distribution to (1) other LLM architectures, (2) LLMs fine-tuned to lie, (3) sycophantic lies, and (4) lies emerging in real-life scenarios such as sales.These results indicate that LLMs have distinctive lierelated behavioural patterns, consistent across architectures and contexts, which could enable general-purpose lie detection.",,,
263311025,CAN SENSITIVE INFORMATION BE DELETED FROM LLMS? OBJECTIVES FOR DEFENDING AGAINST EXTRACTION ATTACKS,"Pretrained language models sometimes possess knowledge that we do not wish them to, including memorized personal information and knowledge that could be used to harm people. They can also output toxic or harmful text. To mitigate these safety and informational issues, we propose an attack-and-defense framework for studying the task of deleting sensitive information directly from model weights. We study direct edits to model weights because (1) this approach should guarantee that particular deleted information is never extracted by future prompt attacks, and (2) it should protect against whitebox attacks, which is necessary for making claims about safety/privacy in a setting where publicly available model weights could be used to elicit sensitive information. Our threat model assumes that an attack succeeds if the answer to a sensitive question is located among a set of B generated candidates, based on scenarios where the information would be insecure if the answer is among B candidates. Experimentally, we show that even state-of-the-art model editing methods such as ROME struggle to truly delete factual information from models like GPT-J, as our whitebox and blackbox attacks can recover ""deleted"" information from an edited model 38% of the time. These attacks leverage two key observations: (1) that traces of deleted information can be found in intermediate model hidden states, and (2) that applying an editing method for one question may not delete information across rephrased versions of the question. Finally, we provide new defense methods that protect against some extraction attacks, but we do not find a single universally effective defense method. Our results suggest that truly deleting sensitive information is a tractable but difficult problem, since even relatively low attack success rates have potentially severe implications for the deployment of language models in a world where individuals enjoy ownership of their personal data, a right to privacy, and safety from harmful model outputs. 1 * Equal contribution. 1 Our code is available at: https://github.com/Vaidehi99/InfoDeletionAttacks arXiv:2309.17410v1 [cs.CL] 29 Sep 2023• How can we ""delete"" specific sensitive information from language models when we do not want models to know or express this information?• How do we test whether that specific information was successfully deleted?Language ModelLanguage Model",,,
263334074,LEGO-PROVER: NEURAL THEOREM PROVING WITH GROWING LIBRARIES,"Despite the success of large language models (LLMs), the task of theorem proving still remains one of the hardest reasoning tasks that is far from being fully solved.Prior methods using language models have demonstrated promising results, but they still struggle to prove even middle school level theorems.One common limitation of these methods is that they assume a fixed theorem library during the whole theorem proving process.However, as we all know, creating new useful theorems or even new theories is not only helpful but crucial and necessary for advancing mathematics and proving harder and deeper results.In this work, we present LEGO-Prover, which employs a growing skill library containing verified lemmas as skills to augment the capability of LLMs used in theorem proving.By constructing the proof modularly, LEGO-Prover enables LLMs to utilize existing skills retrieved from the library and to create new skills during the proving process.These skills are further evolved (by prompting an LLM) to enrich the library on another scale.Modular and reusable skills are constantly added to the library to enable tackling increasingly intricate mathematical problems.Moreover, the learned library further bridges the gap between human proofs and formal proofs by making it easier to impute missing steps.LEGO-Prover advances the stateof-the-art pass rate on miniF2F-valid (48.0% to 57.0%) and miniF2F-test (45.5% to 50.0%).During the proving process, LEGO-Prover also manages to generate over 20,000 skills (theorems/lemmas) and adds them to the growing library.Our ablation study indicates that these newly added skills are indeed helpful for proving theorems, resulting in an improvement from a success rate of 47.1% to 50.4%.We also release our code and all the generated skills. 1",,,
263334567,WIN-WIN: TRAINING HIGH-RESOLUTION VISION TRANSFORMERS FROM TWO WINDOWS,"Transformers have become the standard in state-of-the-art vision architectures, achieving impressive performance on both image-level and dense pixelwise tasks.However, training vision transformers for high-resolution pixelwise tasks has a prohibitive cost.Typical solutions boil down to hierarchical architectures, fast and approximate attention, or training on low-resolution crops.This latter solution does not constrain architectural choices, but it leads to a clear performance drop when testing at resolutions significantly higher than that used for training, thus requiring ad-hoc and slow post-processing schemes.In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for efficient training and inference of high-resolution vision transformers: the key principle is to mask out most of the high-resolution inputs during training, keeping only N random windows.This allows the model to learn local interactions between tokens inside each window, and global interactions between tokens from different windows.As a result, the model can directly process the high-resolution input at test time without any special trick.We show that this strategy is effective when using relative positional embedding such as rotary embeddings.It is 4 times faster to train than a full-resolution network, and it is straightforward to use at test time compared to existing approaches.We apply this strategy to two dense prediction tasks with high resolution data.First, we show on the task of semantic segmentation that a simple setting with 2 windows performs best, hence the name of our method: Win-Win.To demonstrate the generality of our contribution, we further extend it to the binocular task of optical flow, reaching state-of-the-art performance on the Spring benchmark that contains Full-HD images with an inference time an order of magnitude faster than the best competitor.",,,
263334587,Efficient Planning with Latent Diffusion,"Temporal abstraction and efficient planning pose significant challenges in offline reinforcement learning, mainly when dealing with domains that involve temporally extended tasks and delayed sparse rewards.Existing methods typically plan in the raw action space and can be inefficient and inflexible.Latent action spaces offer a more flexible paradigm, capturing only possible actions within the behavior policy support and decoupling the temporal structure between planning and modeling.However, current latent-action-based methods are limited to discrete spaces and require expensive planning.This paper presents a unified framework for continuous latent action space representation learning and planning by leveraging latent, score-based diffusion models.We establish the theoretical equivalence between planning in the latent action space and energy-guided sampling with a pretrained diffusion model and incorporate a novel sequence-level exact sampling method.Our proposed method, LatentDiffuser, demonstrates competitive performance on low-dimensional locomotion control tasks and surpasses existing methods in higher-dimensional tasks.",,,

263605851,GENSIM: GENERATING ROBOTIC SIMULATION TASKS VIA LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS,"Collecting large amounts of real-world interaction data to train general robotic policies is often prohibitively expensive, thus motivating the use of simulation data. However, existing methods for data generation have generally focused on scenelevel diversity (e.g., object instances and poses) rather than task-level diversity, due to the human effort required to come up with and verify novel tasks. This has made it challenging for policies trained on simulation data to demonstrate significant task-level generalization. In this paper, we propose to automatically generate rich simulation environments and expert demonstrations by exploiting a large language models' (LLM) grounding and coding ability. Our approach, dubbed GENSIM, has two modes: goal-directed generation, wherein a target task is given to the LLM and the LLM proposes a task curriculum to solve the target task, and exploratory generation, wherein the LLM bootstraps from previous tasks and iteratively proposes novel tasks that would be helpful in solving more complex tasks. We use GPT4 to expand the existing benchmark by ten times to over 100 tasks, on which we conduct supervised finetuning and evaluate several LLMs including finetuned GPTs and Code Llama on code generation for robotic simulation tasks. Furthermore, we observe that LLMs-generated simulation programs can enhance task-level generalization significantly when used for multitask policy training. We further find that with minimal sim-to-real adaptation, the multitask policies pretrained on GPT4-generated simulation tasks exhibit stronger transfer to unseen long-horizon tasks in the real world and outperform baselines by 25%. 1 , et al.

We prove that with data drawn from the d-dimensional Boolean hypercube labeled by the quadratic ""XOR"" function y = −xixj, it is possible to train to a population error o(1) with dpolylog(d) samples. Our result considers simultaneously training both layers of the two-layer-neural network with ReLU activations via standard minibatch SGD on the logistic loss. To our knowledge, this work is the first to give a sample complexity ofÕ(d) for efficiently learning the XOR function on isotropic data on a standard neural network with standard training. Our main technique is showing that the network evolves in two phases: a signal-finding phase where the network is small and many of the neurons evolve independently to find features, and a signal-heavy phase, where SGD maintains and balances the features. We leverage the simultaneous training of the layers to show that it is sufficient for only a small fraction of the neurons to learn features, since those neurons will be amplified by the simultaneous growth of their second layer weights.",,,
263608672,CLOSING THE CURIOUS CASE OF NEURAL TEXT DEGENERATION,"Despite their ubiquity in language generation, it remains unknown why truncation sampling heuristics like nucleus sampling are so effective.We provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of the truncation sampling by proving that truncation methods that discard tokens below some probability threshold (the most common type of truncation) can guarantee that all sampled tokens have nonzero true probability.However, thresholds are a coarse heuristic, and necessarily discard some tokens with nonzero true probability as well.In pursuit of a more precise sampling strategy, we show that we can leverage a known source of model errors, the softmax bottleneck, to prove that certain tokens have nonzero true probability, without relying on a threshold.Based on our findings, we develop an experimental truncation strategy and the present pilot studies demonstrating the promise of this type of algorithm.Our evaluations show that our method outperforms its threshold-based counterparts under automatic and human evaluation metrics for low-entropy (i.e., close to greedy) open-ended text generation.Our theoretical findings and pilot experiments provide both insight into why truncation sampling works, and make progress toward more expressive sampling algorithms that better surface the generative capabilities of large language models.",,,
263609164,Sample-Efficiency in Multi-Batch Reinforcement Learning: The Need for Dimension-Dependent Adaptivity,"We theoretically explore the relationship between sample-efficiency and adaptivity in reinforcement learning.An algorithm is sample-efficient if it uses a number of queries n to the environment that is polynomial in the dimension d of the problem.Adaptivity refers to the frequency at which queries are sent and feedback is processed to update the querying strategy.To investigate this interplay, we employ a learning framework that allows sending queries in K batches, with feedback being processed and queries updated after each batch.This model encompasses the whole adaptivity spectrum, ranging from non-adaptive 'offline' (K "" 1) to fully adaptive (K "" n) scenarios, and regimes in between.For the problems of policy evaluation and best-policy identification under d-dimensional linear function approximation, we establish Ωplog log dq lower bounds on the number of batches K required for sample-efficient algorithms with n "" Oppolypdqq queries.Our results show that just having adaptivity (K ą 1) does not necessarily guarantee sampleefficiency.Notably, the adaptivity-boundary for sample-efficiency is not between offline reinforcement learning (K "" 1), where sample-efficiency was known to not be possible, and adaptive settings.Instead, the boundary lies between different regimes of adaptivity and depends on the problem dimension.",,,
263609239,LEARNING TO RELAX: SETTING SOLVER PARAMETERS ACROSS A SEQUENCE OF LINEAR SYSTEM INSTANCES,"Solving a linear system Ax = b is a fundamental scientific computing primitive for which numerous solvers and preconditioners have been developed.These come with parameters whose optimal values depend on the system being solved and are often impossible or too expensive to identify; thus in practice sub-optimal heuristics are used.We consider the common setting in which many related linear systems need to be solved, e.g. during a single numerical simulation.In this scenario, can we sequentially choose parameters that attain a near-optimal overall number of iterations, without extra matrix computations?We answer in the affirmative for Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR), a standard solver whose parameter ω has a strong impact on its runtime.For this method, we prove that a bandit online learning algorithm-using only the number of iterations as feedback-can select parameters for a sequence of instances such that the overall cost approaches that of the best fixed ω as the sequence length increases.Furthermore, when given additional structural information, we show that a contextual bandit method asymptotically achieves the performance of the instance-optimal policy, which selects the best ω for each instance.Our work provides the first learning-theoretic treatment of high-precision linear system solvers and the first end-to-end guarantees for data-driven scientific computing, demonstrating theoretically the potential to speed up numerical methods using well-understood learning algorithms.",,,

263620510,NOLA: NETWORKS AS LINEAR COMBINATION OF LOW RANK RANDOM BASIS,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained popularity due to their impressive few-shot performance across various downstream tasks.However, fine-tuning all parameters and storing a unique model for each downstream task or domain becomes impractical because of the massive size of checkpoints (e.g., 350GB in GPT-3).Current literature, such as LoRA, showcases the potential of lowrank modifications to the original weights of an LLM, enabling efficient adaptation and storage for task-specific models.These methods can reduce the number of parameters needed to fine-tune an LLM by several orders of magnitude.Yet, these methods face two primary limitations: 1) the parameter reduction is lower-bounded by the rank one decomposition, and 2) the extent of reduction is heavily influenced by both the model architecture and the chosen rank.For instance, in larger models, even a rank one decomposition might exceed the number of parameters truly needed for adaptation.In this paper, we introduce NOLA, which overcomes the rank one lower bound present in LoRA.It achieves this by re-parameterizing the low-rank matrices in LoRA using linear combinations of randomly generated matrices (basis) and optimizing the linear mixture coefficients only.This approach allows us to decouple the number of trainable parameters from both the choice of rank and the network architecture.We present adaptation results using GPT-2 and ViT in natural language and computer vision tasks.NOLA performs as well as, or better than models with equivalent parameter counts.Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can halve the parameters in larger models compared to LoRA with rank one, without sacrificing performance.Our code is available here: https://github.com/UCDvision/NOLA* Equal Contribution.",,,

263829270,REWARD-CONSISTENT DYNAMICS MODELS ARE STRONGLY GENERALIZABLE FOR OFFLINE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING,"Learning a precise dynamics model can be crucial for offline reinforcement learning, which, unfortunately, has been found to be quite challenging.Dynamics models that are learned by fitting historical transitions often struggle to generalize to unseen transitions.In this study, we identify a hidden but pivotal factor termed dynamics reward that remains consistent across transitions, offering a pathway to better generalization.Therefore, we propose the idea of reward-consistent dynamics models: any trajectory generated by the dynamics model should maximize the dynamics reward derived from the data.We implement this idea as the MOREC (Model-based Offline reinforcement learning with Reward Consistency) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into previous offline model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) methods.MOREC learns a generalizable dynamics reward function from offline data, which is subsequently employed as a transition filter in any offline MBRL method: when generating transitions, the dynamics model generates a batch of transitions and selects the one with the highest dynamics reward value.On a synthetic task, we visualize that MOREC has a strong generalization ability and can surprisingly recover some distant unseen transitions.On 21 offline tasks in D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks, MOREC improves the previous state-of-the-art performance by a significant margin, i.e., 4.6% on D4RL tasks and 25.9% on NeoRL tasks.Notably, MOREC is the first method that can achieve above 95% online RL performance in 6 out of 12 D4RL tasks and 3 out of 9 NeoRL tasks.* CQL (Kumar et al., 2020) adds penalization to Q-values for the samples out of distribution; * TD3+BC (Fujimoto & Gu, 2021) incorporates a BC regularization term into the policy optimization objective; * EDAC (An et al., 2021) proposed to penalize based on the uncertainty degree of the Q-value.Model-based offline RL. * COMBO(Yu et al., 2021) which applies CQL in dyna-style enforces Q-values small on OOD samples; * RAMBO(Rigter et al., 2022) trains the dynamics model adversarially to minimize the value function without loss of accuracy on the transition prediction; * MOPO (Yu et al., 2020) learns a pessimistic value function from rewards penalized with the uncertainty of the dynamics model's prediction; * MOBILE (Sun et al., 2023) penalizes the rewards with uncertainty quantified by the inconsistency of Bellman estimations under an ensemble of learned dynamics models.",,,
263829348,TEMPO: PROMPT-BASED GENERATIVE PRE-TRAINED TRANSFORMER FOR TIME SERIES FORECASTING,"The past decade has witnessed significant advances in time series modeling with deep learning. While achieving state-of-the-art results, the best-performing architectures vary highly across applications and domains. Meanwhile, for natural language processing, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) has demonstrated impressive performance via training one general-purpose model across various textual datasets. It is intriguing to explore whether GPT-type architectures can be effective for time series, capturing the intrinsic dynamic attributes and leading to significant accuracy improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, TEMPO, that can effectively learn time series representations. We focus on utilizing two essential inductive biases of the time series task for pre-trained models: (i) decomposition of the complex interaction between trend, seasonal and residual components; and (ii) introducing the selection-based prompts to facilitate distribution adaptation in non-stationary time series. TEMPO expands the capability for dynamically modeling real-world temporal phenomena from data within diverse domains. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of TEMPOover state-of-the-art methods on a number of time series benchmark datasets. This performance gain is observed not only in standard supervised learning settings but also in scenarios involving previously unseen datasets as well as in scenarios with multi-modal inputs.

Most existing methods devote the referring head to localize the referred object directly, causing failure in complex scenarios. In addition, it does not illustrate how and why the network reaches the final decision. In this paper, we address this question ""Can we design an interpretable 3D visual grounding framework that has the potential to mimic the human perception system?"". To this end, we formulate the 3D visual grounding problem as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) task by first predicting a chain of anchors and then the final target. Interpretability not only improves the overall performance but also helps us identify failure cases. Following the chain of thoughts approach enables us to decompose the referring task into interpretable intermediate steps, boosting the performance and making our framework extremely data-efficient. Moreover, our proposed framework can be easily integrated into any existing architecture. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on the Nr3D, Sr3D, and Scanrefer benchmarks and show consistent performance gains compared to existing methods without requiring manually annotated data.

263830433,Understanding prompt engineering may not require rethinking generalization,"Zero-shot learning in prompted vision-language models, the practice of crafting prompts to build classifiers without an explicit training process, has achieved impressive performance in many settings.This success presents a seemingly surprising observation: these methods suffer relatively little from overfitting, i.e., when a prompt is manually engineered to achieve low error on a given training set (thus rendering the method no longer actually zero-shot), the approach still performs well on held-out test data.In this paper, we show that we can explain such performance well via recourse to classical PAC-Bayes bounds.Specifically, we show that the discrete nature of prompts, combined with a PAC-Bayes prior given by a language model, results in generalization bounds that are remarkably tight by the standards of the literature: for instance, the generalization bound of an ImageNet classifier is often within a few percentage points of the true test error.We demonstrate empirically that this holds for existing handcrafted prompts and prompts generated through simple greedy search.Furthermore, the resulting bound is well-suited for model selection: the models with the best bound typically also have the best test performance.This work thus provides a possible justification for the widespread practice of ""prompt engineering,"" even if it seems that such methods could potentially overfit the training data.",,,

However, a significant limitation of such an approach is its dependency on high-quality human annotations, making its application to intricate tasks challenging due to difficulties in obtaining consistent response demonstrations and in-distribution response preferences. This paper presents a novel approach, namely SALMON (Self-ALignMent with principle-fOllowiNg reward models), to align base language models with minimal human supervision, using only a small set of human-defined principles, yet achieving superior performance. Central to our approach is a principle-following reward model. Trained on synthetic preference data, this model can generate reward scores based on arbitrary human-defined principles. By merely adjusting these principles during the RL training phase, we gain full control over the preferences with the reward model, subsequently influencing the behavior of the RLtrained policies, and eliminating the reliance on the collection of online human preferences. Applying our method to the LLaMA-2-70b base language model, we developed an AI assistant named Dromedary-2. With only 6 exemplars for in-context learning and 31 human-defined principles, Dromedary-2 significantly surpasses the performance of several state-of-the-art AI systems, including LLaMA-2-Chat-70b, on various benchmark datasets.

This paper investigates the efficacy of these ""LLM evaluators"", particularly in using them to assess instruction following, a metric that gauges how closely generated text adheres to the given instruction. We introduce a challenging meta-evaluation benchmark, LLM-BAR, designed to test the ability of an LLM evaluator in discerning instructionfollowing outputs. The authors manually curated 419 pairs of outputs, one adhering to instructions while the other diverging, yet may possess deceptive qualities that mislead an LLM evaluator, e.g., a more engaging tone. Contrary to existing meta-evaluation, we discover that different evaluators (i.e., combinations of LLMs and prompts) exhibit distinct performance on LLMBAR and even the highestscoring ones have substantial room for improvement.

Recently, the remarkable advance of the Large Language Model (LLM) has inspired researchers to transfer its extraordinary reasoning capability to both vision and language data.However, the prevailing approaches primarily regard the visual input as a prompt and focus exclusively on optimizing the text generation process conditioned upon vision content by a frozen LLM.Such an inequitable treatment of vision and language heavily constrains the model's potential.In this paper, we break through this limitation by representing both vision and language in a unified form.Specifically, we introduce a well-designed visual tokenizer to translate the non-linguistic image into a sequence of discrete tokens like a foreign language that LLM can read.The resulting visual tokens encompass high-level semantics worthy of a word and also support dynamic sequence length varying from the image.Coped with this tokenizer, the presented foundation model called LaVIT can handle both image and text indiscriminately under the same generative learning paradigm.This unification empowers LaVIT to serve as an impressive generalist interface to understand and generate multi-modal content simultaneously.Extensive experiments further showcase that it outperforms the existing models by a large margin on massive vision-language tasks.Our code and models will be available at https:",,,
263909212,TOWARDS ROBUST MULTI-MODAL REASONING VIA MODEL SELECTION,"The reasoning capabilities of LLM (Large Language Model) are widely acknowledged in recent research, inspiring studies on tool learning and autonomous agents. LLM serves as the ""brain"" of agent, orchestrating multiple tools for collaborative multi-step task solving. Unlike methods invoking tools like calculators or weather APIs for straightforward tasks, multi-modal agents excel by integrating diverse AI models for complex challenges. However, current multi-modal agents neglect the significance of model selection: they primarily focus on the planning and execution phases, and will only invoke predefined task-specific models for each subtask, making the execution fragile. Meanwhile, other traditional model selection methods are either incompatible with or suboptimal for the multi-modal agent scenarios, due to ignorance of dependencies among subtasks arising by multi-step reasoning. To this end, we identify the key challenges therein and propose the M 3 framework as a plug-in with negligible runtime overhead at test-time. This framework improves model selection and bolsters the robustness of multi-modal agents in multi-step reasoning. In the absence of suitable benchmarks, we create MS-GQA, a new dataset specifically designed to investigate the model selection challenge in multi-modal agents. Our experiments reveal that our framework enables dynamic model selection, considering both user inputs and subtask dependencies, thereby robustifying the overall reasoning process.

263909278,Transformers as Decision Makers: Provable In-Context Reinforcement Learning via Supervised Pretraining,"Large transformer models pretrained on offline reinforcement learning datasets have demonstrated remarkable in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) capabilities, where they can make good decisions when prompted with interaction trajectories from unseen environments. However, when and how transformers can be trained to perform ICRL have not been theoretically well-understood. In particular, it is unclear which reinforcement-learning algorithms transformers can perform in context, and how distribution mismatch in offline training data affects the learned algorithms. This paper provides a theoretical framework that analyzes supervised pretraining for ICRL. This includes two recently proposed training methods -algorithm distillation and decision-pretrained transformers. First, assuming model realizability, we prove the supervised-pretrained transformer will imitate the conditional expectation of the expert algorithm given the observed trajectory. The generalization error will scale with model capacity and a distribution divergence factor between the expert and offline algorithms. Second, we show transformers with ReLU attention can efficiently approximate near-optimal online reinforcement learning algorithms like LinUCB and Thompson sampling for stochastic linear bandits, and UCB-VI for tabular Markov decision processes. This provides the first quantitative analysis of the ICRL capabilities of transformers pretrained from offline trajectories. an online RL algorithm; and (3) when can supervised pretraining find such a good transformer. Specifically, this paper investigates the following open question:How can supervised pretraining on Transformers learn in-context reinforcement learning?In this paper, we initiate a theoretical study of the ICRL capability of transformers under supervised pretraining to address the open questions outlined above. We show that (1) Transformers can implement prevalent RL algorithms, including LinUCB and Thompson sampling for stochastic linear bandits, and UCB-VI for tabular Markov decision processes; (2) The algorithms learned by transformers achieve near-optimal regret bounds in their respective settings; (3) Supervised pretraining find such algorithms as long as the sample size scales with the covering number of transformer class and distribution ratio between expert and offline algorithms.Summary of contributions and paper outline• We propose a general framework for supervised pretraining approaches to meta-reinforcement learning (Section 2). This framework encompasses existing methods like Algorithm Distillation (Laskin et al.,  2022), where the expert and context algorithms are identical, as well as Decision-Pretrained Transformers (Lee et al., 2023), where the expert generates optimal actions for the MDP. It also includes approximate DPT variants where the expert estimates optimal actions from full interaction trajectories.• We prove that the supervised-pretrained transformer will imitate the conditional expectation of the expert algorithm given the observed trajectory (Section 3). The generalization error scales with both model capacity and a distribution ratio measuring divergence between the expert algorithm and the algorithm that generated offline trajectories.• We demonstrate that transformers can effectively approximate several near-optimal reinforcement learning algorithms by taking observed trajectories as context inputs (Section 4). Specifically, we show transformers can approximate LinUCB (Section 4.1) and Thompson sampling algorithms (Section 4.2) for stochastic linear bandit problems, and UCB-VI (Section 4.3) for tabular Markov decision processes. Combined with the generalization error bound from supervised pretraining and regret bounds of these RL algorithms, this provides regret bounds for supervised-pretrained transformers.• Preliminary experiments validate that transformers can perform ICRL in our setup (Section 5).• Technically, we prove efficient approximation of LinUCB by showing transformers can implement accelerated gradient descent for solving ridge regression (Appendix D.4), enabling fewer attention layers than the vanilla gradient descent approach inBai et al. (2023). To enable efficient Thompson sampling implementation, we prove transformers can compute matrix square roots through the Pade decomposition (Appendix E.3). These approximation results are interesting in their own right.",,,
263909429,OMNICONTROL: CONTROL ANY JOINT AT ANY TIME FOR HUMAN MOTION GENERATION,"We present a novel approach named OmniControl for incorporating flexible spatial control signals into a text-conditioned human motion generation model based on the diffusion process.Unlike previous methods that can only control the pelvis trajectory, OmniControl can incorporate flexible spatial control signals over different joints at different times with only one model.Specifically, we propose analytic spatial guidance that ensures the generated motion can tightly conform to the input control signals.At the same time, realism guidance is introduced to refine all the joints to generate more coherent motion.Both the spatial and realism guidance are essential and they are highly complementary for balancing control accuracy and motion realism.By combining them, OmniControl generates motions that are realistic, coherent, and consistent with the spatial constraints.Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets show that OmniControl not only achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods on pelvis control but also shows promising results when incorporating the constraints over other joints.Project page: https://neu-vi.github.io/omnicontrol/.",,,

LEARNING STRONG IMAGE ENCODERS FROM 1 LONG UNLABELLED VIDEO,"Self-supervised learning has unlocked the potential of scaling up pretraining to billions of images, since annotation is unnecessary.But are we making the best use of data?How more economical can we be?In this work, we attempt to answer this question by making two contributions.First, we investigate first-person videos and introduce a ""Walking Tours"" dataset.These videos are high-resolution, hourslong, captured in a single uninterrupted take, depicting a large number of objects and actions with natural scene transitions.They are unlabeled and uncurated, thus realistic for self-supervision and comparable with human learning.Second, we introduce a novel self-supervised image pretraining method tailored for learning from continuous videos.Existing methods typically adapt imagebased pretraining approaches to incorporate more frames.Instead, we advocate a ""tracking to learn to recognize"" approach.Our method called DORA, leads to attention maps that Discover and tRAck objects over time in an end-to-end manner, using transformer cross-attention.We derive multiple views from the tracks and use them in a classical self-supervised distillation loss.Using our novel approach, a single Walking Tours video remarkably becomes a strong competitor to ImageNet for several image and video downstream tasks.",,,
264128166,RETRO-FALLBACK: RETROSYNTHETIC PLANNING IN AN UNCERTAIN WORLD,"Retrosynthesis is the task of proposing a series of chemical reactions to create a desired molecule from simpler, buyable molecules.While previous works have proposed algorithms to find optimal solutions for a range of metrics (e.g.shortest, lowest-cost), these works generally overlook the fact that we have imperfect knowledge of the space of possible reactions, meaning plans created by the algorithm may not work in a laboratory.In this paper we propose a novel formulation of retrosynthesis in terms of stochastic processes to account for this uncertainty.We then propose a novel greedy algorithm called retro-fallback which maximizes the probability that at least one synthesis plan can be executed in the lab.Using in-silico benchmarks we demonstrate that retro-fallback generally produces better sets of synthesis plans than the popular MCTS and retro* algorithms.",,,

264147054,GTA: A GEOMETRY-AWARE ATTENTION MECHANISM FOR MULTI-VIEW TRANSFORMERS,"As transformers are equivariant to the permutation of input tokens, encoding the positional information of tokens is necessary for many tasks.However, since existing positional encoding schemes have been initially designed for NLP tasks, their suitability for vision tasks, which typically exhibit different structural properties in their data, is questionable.We argue that existing positional encoding schemes are suboptimal for 3D vision tasks, as they do not respect their underlying 3D geometric structure.Based on this hypothesis, we propose a geometryaware attention mechanism that encodes the geometric structure of tokens as relative transformation determined by the geometric relationship between queries and key-value pairs.By evaluating on multiple novel view synthesis (NVS) datasets in the sparse wide-baseline multi-view setting, we show that our attention, called Geometric Transform Attention (GTA), improves learning efficiency and performance of state-of-the-art transformer-based NVS models without any additional learned parameters and only minor computational overhead.",,,
264172174,CONTEXT-AWARE META-LEARNING,"Large Language Models like ChatGPT demonstrate a remarkable capacity to learn new concepts during inference without any fine-tuning. However, visual models trained to detect new objects during inference have been unable to replicate this ability, and instead either perform poorly or require meta-training and/or finetuning on similar objects. In this work, we propose a meta-learning algorithm that emulates Large Language Models by learning new visual concepts during inference without fine-tuning. Our approach leverages a frozen pre-trained feature extractor, and analogous to in-context learning, recasts meta-learning as sequence modeling over datapoints with known labels and a test datapoint with an unknown label. On 8 out of 11 meta-learning benchmarks, our approach-without meta-training or fine-tuning-exceeds or matches the state-of-the-art algorithm, P>M>F, which is meta-trained on these benchmarks.Under Review classify the query given an input sequence composed of the support set and query point. This learning paradigm trains the Transformer encoder to extrapolate to new classes in the parameter-space of the model, enabling our approach to learn new visual concepts during inference without fine-tuning. Due to its capacity to learn visual information ""in-context"", we term our approach Context-Aware Meta-Learning (CAML).Our primary contribution is to develop a meta-learning algorithm for universal meta-learning: the capacity to learn any new visual concept during inference without fine-tuning or meta-training on related images. This challenging setting emulates the deployment of LLMs to real-time applications, and strong performance in this setting would unlock new applications of visual meta-learning. Our theoretical analysis shows that an ELMES is the encoding that minimizes the entropy of detecting classes within the support set, and therefore, does not need to be learned. Our empirical analysis highlights the importance of reformulating meta-learning as sequence modeling: considering the support set and query together enables the model to attend to specific visual features of images in the support set to classify the query. Finally, our empirical analysis indicates CAML is a state-of-the-art meta-learning algorithm. On a diverse set of 8 out of 11 meta-learning benchmarks-and without meta-training or fine-tuning-CAML outperforms or matches the performance of P>M>F (Hu et al., 2022), a state-of-the-art meta-learning algorithm that is meta-trained on each benchmark.",,,
264172668,SEEKING NEURAL NUGGETS: KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS FROM A PARAMETRIC PERSPECTIVE,"Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently encode a wealth of knowledge within their parameters through pre-training on extensive corpora. While prior research has delved into operations on these parameters to manipulate the underlying implicit knowledge-encompassing detection, editing, and merging-there remains an ambiguous understanding regarding their transferability across models with varying scales. In this paper, we seek to empirically investigate knowledge transfer from larger to smaller models through a parametric perspective. To achieve this, we employ sensitivity-based techniques to extract and align knowledgespecific parameters between different LLMs. Moreover, the LoRA module is used as the intermediary mechanism for injecting the extracted knowledge into smaller models. Evaluations across four benchmarks validate the efficacy of our proposed method. Our findings highlight the critical factors contributing to the process of parametric knowledge transfer, underscoring the transferability of model parameters across LLMs of different scales.

264172845,LIE GROUP DECOMPOSITIONS FOR EQUIVARIANT NEURAL NETWORKS,"Invariance and equivariance to geometrical transformations have proven to be very useful inductive biases when training (convolutional) neural network models, especially in the low-data regime. Much work has focused on the case where the symmetry group employed is compact or abelian, or both. Recent work has explored enlarging the class of transformations used to the case of Lie groups, principally through the use of their Lie algebra, as well as the group exponential and logarithm maps. The applicability of such methods to larger transformation groups is limited by the fact that depending on the group of interest G, the exponential map may not be surjective. Further limitations are encountered when G is neither compact nor abelian. Using the structure and geometry of Lie groups and their homogeneous spaces, we present a framework by which it is possible to work with such groups primarily focusing on the Lie groups G = GL + (n, R) and G = SL(n, R), as well as their representation as affine transformations R n ⋊ G. Invariant integration as well as a global parametrization is realized by decomposing the 'larger' groups into subgroups and submanifolds which can be handled individually. Under this framework, we show how convolution kernels can be parametrized to build models equivariant with respect to affine transformations. We evaluate the robustness and out-of-distribution generalisation capability of our model on the standard affine-invariant benchmark classification task, where we outperform all previous equivariant models as well as all Capsule Network proposals. .

To this end, we present video language planning (VLP), an algorithm that consists of a tree search procedure, where we train (i) vision-language models to serve as both policies and value functions, and (ii) text-to-video models as dynamics models. VLP takes as input a long-horizon task instruction and current image observation, and outputs a long video plan that provides detailed multimodal (video and language) specifications that describe how to complete the final task. VLP scales with increasing computation budget where more computation time results in improved video plans, and is able to synthesize long-horizon video plans across different robotics domainsfrom multi-object rearrangement, to multi-camera bi-arm dexterous manipulation. Generated video plans can be translated into real robot actions via goal-conditioned policies, conditioned on each intermediate frame of the generated video.

264288700,In defense of parameter sharing for model-compression,"When considering a model architecture, there are several ways to reduce its memory footprint.Historically, popular approaches included selecting smaller architectures and creating sparse networks through pruning.More recently, randomized parameter-sharing (RPS) methods have gained traction for model compression at start of training.In this paper, we comprehensively assess the trade-off between memory and accuracy across RPS, pruning techniques, and building smaller models.Our findings demonstrate that RPS, which is both data and model-agnostic, consistently outperforms/matches smaller models and all moderately informed pruning strategies, such as MAG, SNIP, SYNFLOW, and GRASP, across the entire compression range.This advantage becomes particularly pronounced in higher compression scenarios.Notably, even when compared to highly informed pruning techniques like Lottery Ticket Rewinding (LTR), RPS exhibits superior performance in high compression settings.This points out inherent capacity advantage that RPS enjoys over sparse models.Theoretically, we establish RPS as a superior technique in terms of memory-efficient representation when compared to pruning for linear models.This paper argues in favor of paradigm shift towards RPS based models.During our rigorous evaluation of RPS, we identified issues in the stateof-the-art RPS technique ROAST, specifically regarding stability (ROAST's sensitivity to initialization hyperparameters, often leading to divergence) and Paretocontinuity (ROAST's inability to recover the accuracy of the original model at zero compression).We provably address both of these issues.We refer to the modified RPS, which incorporates our improvements, as STABLE-RPS.Preprint.Under review.",,,
264288929,Towards Optimal Regret in Adversarial Linear MDPs with Bandit Feedback,"We study online reinforcement learning in linear Markov decision processes with adversarial losses and bandit feedback, without prior knowledge on transitions or access to simulators.We introduce two algorithms that achieve improved regret performance compared to existing approaches.The first algorithm, although computationally inefficient, ensures a regret of O( √ K), where K is the number of episodes.This is the first result with the optimal K dependence in the considered setting.The second algorithm, which is based on the policy optimization framework, guarantees a regret of O(K 3 /4 ) and is computationally efficient.Both our results significantly improve over the state-of-the-art: a computationally inefficient algorithm by Kong et al. [2023]  with O(K 4 /5 + poly( 1 /λmin)) regret, for some problem-dependent constant λ min that can be arbitrarily close to zero, and a computationally efficient algorithm by Sherman et al. [2023b]  with O(K 6 /7 ) regret.* The authors are listed in alphabetical order.is the horizon length.The challenge is that this conversion depends on the transition of the MDP, which is not available to the learner.Therefore, the learner has to estimate the feature of every policy during the learning process.Previous work in this direction [Kong et al., 2023]  faced obstacles in controlling the estimation error and was only able to show a K 4 /5 +poly( 1 /λ min ) regret bound assuming there exists an exploratory policy inducing a covariance matrix λ min I.We addressed the obstacles through 1) state space discretization (Section 3.2), and 2) model-free estimation for the occupancy measure of policies over the discretized state space (Section 3.3).These allow us to emulate the success in the tabular case [Jin et al., 2020a] and obtain the tight √ K regret.Efficient K 3 /4 algorithm.The efficient algorithm is based on the policy optimization framework[Luo et al., 2021].Different from previous works that all use exponential weights, we use Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) with log-determinant (logdet) barrier regularizer to perform policy updates, which has the benefit of keeping the algorithm more stable [Zimmert and Lattimore, 2022, Liu et al., 2023a].We carefully combine logdet-FTRL with existing algorithmic/analysis techniques to further improve the regret bound.These include 1) an initial exploration phase to control the transition estimation error [Sherman et al., 2023a], 2) optimistic least-square policy evaluation in bonus construction [Sherman et al., 2023b], 3) dilated bonus construction[Luo et al., 2021], and 4) a tighter concentration bound for covariance matrix estimation [Liu et al., 2023a].Related WorkIn this subsection, we review prior works on adversarial MDPs and policy optimization.Learning in Adversarial MDPs.Adversarial MDPs refer to a class of MDP problems where the transition is fixed while the loss function changes over time.Learning adversarial tabular MDPs under bandit feedback and unknown transition has been extensively studied [",,,
264289064,GROUP PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION: FEW-SHOT ALIGNMENT OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS,"Many applications of large language models (LLMs), ranging from chatbots to creative writing, require nuanced subjective judgments that can differ significantly across different groups.Existing alignment algorithms can be expensive to align for each group, requiring prohibitive amounts of group-specific preference data and computation for real-world use cases.We introduce Group Preference Optimization (GPO), an alignment framework that steers language models to preferences of individual groups in a few-shot manner.In GPO, we augment the base LLM with an independent transformer module trained to predict the preferences of a group for the LLM generations.For few-shot learning, we parameterize this module as an in-context autoregressive transformer and train it via meta-learning on several groups.We empirically validate the efficacy of GPO through rigorous evaluations using LLMs with varied sizes on three human opinion adaptation tasks.These tasks involve adapting to the preferences of US demographic groups, global countries, and individual users.Our results demonstrate that GPO not only aligns models more accurately but also requires fewer group-specific preferences, and less training and inference computing resources, outperforming existing strategies such as in-context steering and fine-tuning methods. 1 Warning: This paper contains qualitative examples that may be viewed as offensive or harmful.",,,
264306002,CCIL: CONTINUITY-BASED DATA AUGMENTATION FOR CORRECTIVE IMITATION LEARNING,"We present a new technique to enhance the robustness of imitation learning methods by generating corrective data to account for compounding errors and disturbances.While existing methods rely on interactive expert labeling, additional offline datasets, or domain-specific invariances, our approach requires minimal additional assumptions beyond access to expert data.The key insight is to leverage local continuity in the environment dynamics to generate corrective labels.Our method first constructs a dynamics model from the expert demonstration, encouraging local Lipschitz continuity in the learned model.In locally continuous regions, this model allows us to generate corrective labels within the neighborhood of the demonstrations but beyond the actual set of states and actions in the dataset.Training on this augmented data enhances the agent's ability to recover from perturbations and deal with compounding errors.We demonstrate the effectiveness of our generated labels through experiments in a variety of robotics domains in simulation that have distinct forms of continuity and discontinuity, including classic control problems, drone flying, navigation with high-dimensional sensor observations, legged locomotion, and tabletop manipulation.",,,
264306022,VARIATIONAL INFERENCE FOR SDES DRIVEN BY FRACTIONAL NOISE,"We present a novel variational framework for performing inference in (neural) stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by Markov-approximate fractional Brownian motion (fBM).SDEs offer a versatile tool for modeling real-world continuous-time dynamic systems with inherent noise and randomness.Combining SDEs with the powerful inference capabilities of variational methods, enables the learning of representative function distributions through stochastic gradient descent.However, conventional SDEs typically assume the underlying noise to follow a Brownian motion (BM), which hinders their ability to capture long-term dependencies.In contrast, fractional Brownian motion (fBM) extends BM to encompass non-Markovian dynamics, but existing methods for inferring fBM parameters are either computationally demanding or statistically inefficient.In this paper, building upon the Markov approximation of fBM, we derive the evidence lower bound essential for efficient variational inference of posterior path measures, drawing from the well-established field of stochastic analysis.Additionally, we provide a closed-form expression to determine optimal approximation coefficients.Furthermore, we propose the use of neural networks to learn the drift, diffusion and control terms within our variational posterior, leading to the variational training of neural-SDEs.In this framework, we also optimize the Hurst index, governing the nature of our fractional noise.Beyond validation on synthetic data, we contribute a novel architecture for variational latent video prediction,-an approach that, to the best of our knowledge, enables the first variational neural-SDE application to video perception.",,,
264306078,SAFE RLHF: SAFE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FROM HUMAN FEEDBACK,"With the development of large language models (LLMs), striking a balance between the performance and safety of AI systems has never been more critical.However, the inherent tension between the objectives of helpfulness and harmlessness presents a significant challenge during LLM training.To address this issue, we propose Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Safe RLHF), a novel algorithm for human value alignment.Safe RLHF explicitly decouples human preferences regarding helpfulness and harmlessness, effectively avoiding the crowdworkers' confusion about the tension and allowing us to train separate reward and cost models.We formalize the safety concern of LLMs as an optimization task of maximizing the reward function while satisfying specified cost constraints.Leveraging the Lagrangian method to solve this constrained problem, Safe RLHF dynamically adjusts the balance between the two objectives during fine-tuning.Through a three-round fine-tuning using Safe RLHF, we demonstrate a superior ability to mitigate harmful responses while enhancing model performance compared to existing value-aligned algorithms.Experimentally, we finetuned the Alpaca-7B using Safe RLHF and aligned it with collected human preferences, significantly improving its helpfulness and harmlessness according to human evaluations.",,,
264306111,FROZEN TRANSFORMERS IN LANGUAGE MODELS ARE EFFECTIVE VISUAL ENCODER LAYERS,"This paper reveals that large language models (LLMs), despite being trained solely on textual data, are surprisingly strong encoders for purely visual tasks in the absence of language.Even more intriguingly, this can be achieved by a simple yet previously overlooked strategy -employing a frozen transformer block from pre-trained LLMs as a constituent encoder layer to directly process visual tokens.Our work pushes the boundaries of leveraging LLMs for computer vision tasks, significantly departing from conventional practices that typically necessitate a multi-modal vision-language setup with associated language prompts, inputs, or outputs.We demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances performance across a diverse range of tasks, encompassing pure 2D and 3D visual recognition tasks (e.g., image and point cloud classification), temporal modeling tasks (e.g., action recognition), non-semantic tasks (e.g., motion forecasting), and multi-modal tasks (e.g., 2D/3D visual question answering and image-text retrieval).Such improvements are a general phenomenon, applicable to various types of LLMs (e.g., LLaMA and OPT) and different LLM transformer blocks.We additionally propose the information filtering hypothesis to explain the effectiveness of pre-trained LLMs in visual encoding -the pre-trained LLM transformer blocks discern informative visual tokens and further amplify their effect.This hypothesis is empirically supported by the observation that the feature activation, after training with LLM transformer blocks, exhibits a stronger focus on relevant regions.We hope that our work inspires new perspectives on utilizing LLMs and deepening our understanding of their underlying mechanisms.Code is available at https://github.com/ziqipang/LM4VisualEncoding.",,,

264426013,A QUADRATIC SYNCHRONIZATION RULE FOR DISTRIBUTED DEEP LEARNING,"In distributed deep learning with data parallelism, synchronizing gradients at each training step can cause a huge communication overhead, especially when many nodes work together to train large models.Local gradient methods, such as Local SGD, address this issue by allowing workers to compute locally for H steps without synchronizing with others, hence reducing communication frequency.While H has been viewed as a hyperparameter to trade optimization efficiency for communication cost, recent research indicates that setting a proper H value can lead to generalization improvement.Yet, selecting a proper H is elusive.This work proposes a theory-grounded method for determining H, named the Quadratic Synchronization Rule (QSR), which recommends dynamically setting H in proportion to 1 η 2 as the learning rate η decays over time.Extensive ImageNet experiments on ResNet and ViT show that local gradient methods with QSR consistently improve the test accuracy over other synchronization strategies. 1 Compared with the standard data parallel training, QSR enables Local AdamW on ViT-B to cut the training time on 16 or 64 GPUs down from 26.7 to 20.2 hours or from 8.6 to 5.5 hours and, at the same time, achieves 1.16% or 0.84% higher top-1 validation accuracy.",,,
264426077,What's in a Prior? Learned Proximal Networks for Inverse Problems,"Proximal operators are ubiquitous in inverse problems, commonly appearing as part of algorithmic strategies to regularize problems that are otherwise ill-posed.Modern deep learning models have been brought to bear for these tasks too, as in the framework of plug-and-play or deep unrolling, where they loosely resemble proximal operators.Yet, something essential is lost in employing these purely data-driven approaches: there is no guarantee that a general deep network represents the proximal operator of any function, nor is there any characterization of the function for which the network might provide some approximate proximal.This not only makes guaranteeing convergence of iterative schemes challenging but, more fundamentally, complicates the analysis of what has been learned by these networks about their training data.Herein we provide a framework to develop learned proximal networks (LPN), prove that they provide exact proximal operators for a data-driven nonconvex regularizer, and show how a new training strategy, dubbed proximal matching, provably promotes the recovery of the log-prior of the true data distribution.Such LPN provide general, unsupervised, expressive proximal operators that can be used for general inverse problems with convergence guarantees.We illustrate our results in a series of cases of increasing complexity, demonstrating that these models not only result in state-of-the-art performance, but provide a window into the resulting priors learned from data.",,,

264438909,ONE-HOT GENERALIZED LINEAR MODEL FOR SWITCHING BRAIN STATE DISCOVERY,"Exposing meaningful and interpretable neural interactions is critical to understanding neural circuits.Inferred neural interactions from neural signals primarily reflect functional interactions.In a long experiment, subject animals may experience different stages defined by the experiment, stimuli, or behavioral states, and hence functional interactions can change over time.To model dynamically changing functional interactions, prior work employs state-switching generalized linear models with hidden Markov models (i.e., HMM-GLMs).However, we argue they lack biological plausibility, as functional interactions are shaped and confined by the underlying anatomical connectome.Here, we propose a novel prior-informed state-switching GLM.We introduce both a Gaussian prior and a one-hot prior over the GLM in each state.The priors are learnable.We will show that the learned prior should capture the state-constant interaction, shedding light on the underlying anatomical connectome and revealing more likely physical neuron interactions.The state-dependent interaction modeled by each GLM offers traceability to capture functional variations across multiple brain states.Our methods effectively recover true interaction structures in simulated data, achieve the highest predictive likelihood with real neural datasets, and render interaction structures and hidden states more interpretable when applied to real neural data.",,,

264825357,MgNO: Efficient Parameterization of Linear Operators via Multigrid,"In this work, we propose a concise neural operator architecture for operator learning.Drawing an analogy with a conventional fully connected neural network, we define the neural operator as follows: the output of the i-th neuron in a nonlinear operator layer is defined by O i (u) = σ j W i j u + B i j .Here, W i j denotes the bounded linear operator connecting j-th input neuron to i-th output neuron, and the bias B i j takes the form of a function rather than a scalar.Given its new universal approximation property, the efficient parameterization of the bounded linear operators between two neurons (Banach spaces) plays a critical role.As a result, we introduce MgNO, utilizing multigrid structures to parameterize these linear operators between neurons.This approach offers both mathematical rigor and practical expressivity.Additionally, MgNO obviates the need for conventional lifting and projecting operators typically required in previous neural operators.Moreover, it seamlessly accommodates diverse boundary conditions.Our empirical observations reveal that MgNO exhibits superior ease of training compared to other CNNbased models, while also displaying a reduced susceptibility to overfitting when contrasted with spectral-type neural operators.We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our method with consistently state-of-the-art performance on different types of partial differential equations (PDEs).",,,

264825556,BESPOKE SOLVERS FOR GENERATIVE FLOW MODELS,"Diffusion or flow-based models are powerful generative paradigms that are notoriously hard to sample as samples are defined as solutions to high-dimensional Ordinary or Stochastic Differential Equations (ODEs/SDEs) which require a large Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) to approximate well.Existing methods to alleviate the costly sampling process include model distillation and designing dedicated ODE solvers.However, distillation is costly to train and sometimes can deteriorate quality, while dedicated solvers still require relatively large NFE to produce high quality samples.In this paper we introduce ""Bespoke solvers"", a novel framework for constructing custom ODE solvers tailored to the ODE of a given pre-trained flow model.Our approach optimizes an order consistent and parameter-efficient solver (e.g., with 80 learnable parameters), is trained for roughly 1% of the GPU time required for training the pre-trained model, and significantly improves approximation and generation quality compared to dedicated solvers.For example, a Bespoke solver for a CIFAR10 model produces samples with Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 2.73 with 10 NFE, and gets to 1% of the Ground Truth (GT) FID (2.59) for this model with only 20 NFE.On the more challenging ImageNet-64×64, Bespoke samples at 2.2 FID with 10 NFE, and gets within 2% of GT FID (1.71) with 20 NFE.",,,
27494814,"To prune, or not to prune: exploring the efficacy of pruning for model compression","Model pruning seeks to induce sparsity in a deep neural network's various connection matrices, thereby reducing the number of nonzero-valued parameters in the model. Recent reports(Han et al., 2015a;Narang et al., 2017)prune deep networks at the cost of only a marginal loss in accuracy and achieve a sizable reduction in model size. This hints at the possibility that the baseline models in these experiments are perhaps severely over-parameterized at the outset and a viable alternative for model compression might be to simply reduce the number of hidden units while maintaining the model's dense connection structure, exposing a similar trade-off in model size and accuracy. We investigate these two distinct paths for model compression within the context of energy-efficient inference in resource-constrained environments and propose a new gradual pruning technique that is simple and straightforward to apply across a variety of models/datasets with minimal tuning and can be seamlessly incorporated within the training process. We compare the accuracy of large, but pruned models (large-sparse) and their smaller, but dense (small-dense) counterparts with identical memory footprint. Across a broad range of neural network architectures (deep CNNs, stacked LSTM, and seq2seq LSTM models), we find large-sparse models to consistently outperform small-dense models and achieve up to 10x reduction in number of non-zero parameters with minimal loss in accuracy.",,,

Since most of the computation in training neural networks is typically spent on floating point multiplications, we investigate an approach to training that eliminates the need for most of these. Our method consists of two parts: First we stochastically binarize weights to convert multiplications involved in computing hidden states to sign changes. Second, while back-propagating error derivatives, in addition to binarizing the weights, we quantize the representations at each layer to convert the remaining multiplications into binary shifts. Experimental results across 3 popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, SVHN) show that this approach not only does not hurt classification performance but can result in even better performance than standard stochastic gradient descent training, paving the way to fast, hardwarefriendly training of neural networks.",,,

To trade off quality and delay, we extensively explore various targets for delay and design a method for beam-search applicable in the simultaneous MT setting.

29778779,INTRIGUING PROPERTIES OF ADVERSARIAL EXAM- PLES,"It is becoming increasingly clear that many machine learning classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples. In attempting to explain the origin of adversarial examples, previous studies have typically focused on the fact that neural networks operate on high dimensional data, they overfit, or they are too linear. Here we argue that the origin of adversarial examples is primarily due to an inherent uncertainty that neural networks have about their predictions. We show that the functional form of this uncertainty is independent of architecture, dataset, and training protocol; and depends only on the statistics of the logit differences of the network, which do not change significantly during training. This leads to adversarial error having a universal scaling, as a power-law, with respect to the size of the adversarial perturbation. We show that this universality holds for a broad range of datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet, and random data), models (including state-of-theart deep networks, linear models, adversarially trained networks, and networks trained on randomly shuffled labels), and attacks (FGSM, step l.l., PGD). Motivated by these results, we study the effects of reducing prediction entropy on adversarial robustness. Finally, we study the effect of network architectures on adversarial sensitivity. To do this, we use neural architecture search with reinforcement learning to find adversarially robust architectures on CIFAR10. Our resulting architecture is more robust to white and black box attacks compared to previous attempts. * Work done as a member of the Google Brain Residency program (g.co/brainresidency).",,,

30535508,LEARNING SPARSE NEURAL NETWORKS THROUGH L 0 REGULARIZATION,"We propose a practical method for L 0 norm regularization for neural networks: pruning the network during training by encouraging weights to become exactly zero. Such regularization is interesting since (1) it can greatly speed up training and inference, and (2) it can improve generalization. AIC and BIC, well-known model selection criteria, are special cases of L 0 regularization. However, since the L 0 norm of weights is non-differentiable, we cannot incorporate it directly as a regularization term in the objective function. We propose a solution through the inclusion of a collection of non-negative stochastic gates, which collectively determine which weights to set to zero. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, for certain distributions over the gates, the expected L 0 norm of the resulting gated weights is differentiable with respect to the distribution parameters. We further propose the hard concrete distribution for the gates, which is obtained by ""stretching"" a binary concrete distribution and then transforming its samples with a hard-sigmoid. The parameters of the distribution over the gates can then be jointly optimized with the original network parameters. As a result our method allows for straightforward and efficient learning of model structures with stochastic gradient descent and allows for conditional computation in a principled way. We perform various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting approach and regularizer.",,,

Our tasks measure understanding in several ways: whether a system is able to answer questions via chaining facts, simple induction, deduction and many more. The tasks are designed to be prerequisites for any system that aims to be capable of conversing with a human. We believe many existing learning systems can currently not solve them, and hence our aim is to classify these tasks into skill sets, so that researchers can identify (and then rectify) the failings of their systems. We also extend and improve the recently introduced Memory Networks model, and show it is able to solve some, but not all, of the tasks.",,,

Toward this end, we present in this paper a unifying landscape analysis framework that can be used when the training objective function is the composite of simple functions.Using the local openness property of the underlying training models, we provide simple sufficient conditions under which any local optimum of the resulting optimization problem is globally optimal. We first completely characterize the local openness of the symmetric and non-symmetric matrix multiplication mapping . Then we use our characterization to: 1) provide a simple proof for the classical result of Burer-Monteiro and extend it to non-continuous loss functions. 2) Show that every local optimum of two layer linear networks is globally optimal. Unlike many existing results in the literature, our result requires no assumption on the target data matrix Y, and input data matrix X.3) Develop a complete characterization of the local/global optima equivalence of multi-layer linear neural networks. We provide various counterexamples to show the necessity of each of our assumptions. 4) Show global/local optima equivalence of over-parameterized non-linear deep models having a certain pyramidal structure.

But, even memory networks with sophisticated addressing schemes are unable to learn intelligent reasoning satisfactorily due to the complexity of simultaneously learning to access memory and plan. To mitigate these challenges we propose the Memory Augmented Control Network (MACN). The network splits planning into a hierarchical process. At a lower level, it learns to plan in the locally observed space. At a higher level, it uses a collection of policies computed on locally observed spaces to learn the optimal plan in the global environment it is operating in.

Previously, it has been shown that neural network agents can learn to communicate in a highly structured, possibly compositional language based on disentangled input (e.g. handengineered features). Humans, however, do not learn to communicate based on well-summarized features. In this work, we train neural agents to simultaneously develop visual perception from raw image pixels, and learn to communicate with a sequence of discrete symbols. The agents play an image description game where the image contains factors such as colors and shapes. We train the agents using the obverter technique where an agent introspects to generate messages that maximize its own understanding.

3464416,TRAINING CONFIDENCE-CALIBRATED CLASSIFIERS FOR DETECTING OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION SAMPLES,"The problem of detecting whether a test sample is from in-distribution (i.e., training distribution by a classifier) or out-of-distribution sufficiently different from it arises in many real-world machine learning applications. However, the state-of-art deep neural networks are known to be highly overconfident in their predictions, i.e., do not distinguish in-and out-of-distributions. Recently, to handle this issue, several threshold-based detectors have been proposed given pre-trained neural classifiers. However, the performance of prior works highly depends on how to train the classifiers since they only focus on improving inference procedures. In this paper, we develop a novel training method for classifiers so that such inference algorithms can work better. In particular, we suggest two additional terms added to the original loss (e.g., cross entropy). The first one forces samples from out-of-distribution less confident by the classifier and the second one is for (implicitly) generating most effective training samples for the first one. In essence, our method jointly trains both classification and generative neural networks for out-of-distribution. We demonstrate its effectiveness using deep convolutional neural networks on various popular image datasets.",,,
3484654,RECASTING GRADIENT-BASED META-LEARNING AS HIERARCHICAL BAYES,"Meta-learning allows an intelligent agent to leverage prior learning episodes as a basis for quickly improving performance on a novel task. Bayesian hierarchical modeling provides a theoretical framework for formalizing meta-learning as inference for a set of parameters that are shared across tasks. Here, we reformulate the model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm (MAML) of Finn et al.(2017)as a method for probabilistic inference in a hierarchical Bayesian model. In contrast to prior methods for meta-learning via hierarchical Bayes, MAML is naturally applicable to complex function approximators through its use of a scalable gradient descent procedure for posterior inference. Furthermore, the identification of MAML as hierarchical Bayes provides a way to understand the algorithm's operation as a meta-learning procedure, as well as an opportunity to make use of computational strategies for efficient inference. We use this opportunity to propose an improvement to the MAML algorithm that makes use of techniques from approximate inference and curvature estimation.",,,
3502463,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018 DEEP BAYESIAN BANDITS SHOWDOWN AN EMPIRICAL COMPARISON OF BAYESIAN DEEP NETWORKS FOR THOMPSON SAMPLING,"Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have made significant strides in performance on applications such as Go and Atari games. However, developing practical methods to balance exploration and exploitation in complex domains remains largely unsolved. Thompson Sampling and its extension to reinforcement learning provide an elegant approach to exploration that only requires access to posterior samples of the model. At the same time, advances in approximate Bayesian methods have made posterior approximation for flexible neural network models practical. Thus, it is attractive to consider approximate Bayesian neural networks in a Thompson Sampling framework. To understand the impact of using an approximate posterior on Thompson Sampling, we benchmark well-established and recently developed methods for approximate posterior sampling combined with Thompson Sampling over a series of contextual bandit problems. We found that many approaches that have been successful in the supervised learning setting underperformed in the sequential decision-making scenario. In particular, we highlight the challenge of adapting slowly converging uncertainty estimates to the online setting. * Google AI Resident Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018 1: Input: Prior distribution over models, π 0 : θ ∈ Θ → [0, 1]. 2: for time t = 0, . . . , N do 3:Observe context X t ∈ R d .4:Sample model θ t ∼ π t .5:Compute a t = BestAction(X t , θ t ).6:Select action a t and observe reward r t .7:Update posterior distribution π t+1 with (X t , a t , r t ).In the following sections we rely on the idea that, if we had access to the actual posterior π t given the observed data at all times t, then choosing actions using Thompson Sampling would lead to near-optimal cumulative regret or, more informally, to good performance. It is important to remark that in some problems this is not necessarily the case; for example, when actions that have no chance of being optimal still convey useful information about other actions. Thompson Sampling (or UCB approaches) would never select such actions, even if they are worth their cost (Russo & Van Roy,  2014). In addition, Thompson Sampling does not take into account the time horizon where the process ends, and if known, exploration efforts should be tuned accordingly (Russo et al., 2017). Nonetheless, under the assumption that very accurate posterior approximations lead to efficient decisions, the question is: what happens when the approximations are not so accurate? In some cases, the mismatch in posteriors may not hurt in terms of decision making, and we will still end up with good decisions. Unfortunately, in other cases, this mismatch together with its induced feedback loop will degenerate in a significant loss of performance. We would like to understand the main aspects that determine which way it goes. This is an important practical question as, in large and complex systems, computational sacrifices and statistical assumptions are made to favor simplicity and tractability.

This paper establishes formal connections between deep generative modeling approaches through a new formulation of GANs and VAEs. We show that GANs and VAEs are essentially minimizing KL divergences of respective posterior and inference distributions with opposite directions, extending the two learning phases of classic wake-sleep algorithm, respectively. The unified view provides a powerful tool to analyze a diverse set of existing model variants, and enables to exchange ideas across research lines in a principled way.

We shed light on this by proving that the total number of neurons m required to approximate natural classes of multivariate polynomials of n variables grows only linearly with n for deep neural networks, but grows exponentially when merely a single hidden layer is allowed. We also provide evidence that when the number of hidden layers is increased from 1 to k, the neuron requirement grows exponentially not with n but with n 1/k , suggesting that the minimum number of layers required for computational tractability grows only logarithmically with n.",,,
3516266,"DON'T DECAY THE LEARNING RATE, INCREASE THE BATCH SIZE","It is common practice to decay the learning rate. Here we show one can usually obtain the same learning curve on both training and test sets by instead increasing the batch size during training. This procedure is successful for stochastic gradient descent (SGD), SGD with momentum, Nesterov momentum, and Adam. It reaches equivalent test accuracies after the same number of training epochs, but with fewer parameter updates, leading to greater parallelism and shorter training times. We can further reduce the number of parameter updates by increasing the learning rate and scaling the batch size B ∝ . Finally, one can increase the momentum coefficient m and scale B ∝ 1/(1 − m), although this tends to slightly reduce the test accuracy. Crucially, our techniques allow us to repurpose existing training schedules for large batch training with no hyper-parameter tuning.

We analyze approximate inference in variational autoencoders in terms of these factors. We find that suboptimal inference is often due to amortizing inference rather than the limited complexity of the approximating distribution. We show that this is due partly to the generator learning to accommodate the choice of approximation. Furthermore, we show that the parameters used to increase the expressiveness of the approximation play a role in generalizing inference rather than simply improving the complexity of the approximation.",,,
3532296,CAN RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS WARP TIME?,"Successful recurrent models such as long short-term memories (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) use ad hoc gating mechanisms. Empirically these models have been found to improve the learning of medium to long term temporal dependencies and to help with vanishing gradient issues. We prove that learnable gates in a recurrent model formally provide quasiinvariance to general time transformations in the input data. We recover part of the LSTM architecture from a simple axiomatic approach. This result leads to a new way of initializing gate biases in LSTMs and GRUs. Experimentally, this new chrono initialization is shown to greatly improve learning of long term dependencies, with minimal implementation effort.Recurrent neural networks (e.g.(Jaeger, 2002)) are a standard machine learning tool to model and represent temporal data; mathematically they amount to learning the parameters of a parameterized dynamical system so that its behavior optimizes some criterion, such as the prediction of the next data in a sequence.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018 explains why this is reasonable in most cases, when facing medium term dependencies, but fails when facing long to very long term dependencies.",,,
3557557,Investigating Human Priors for Playing Video Games,"What makes humans so good at solving seemingly complex video games? Unlike computers, humans bring in a great deal of prior knowledge about the world, enabling efficient decision making. This paper investigates the role of human priors for solving video games. Given a sample game, we conduct a series of ablation studies to quantify the importance of various priors on human performance. We do this by modifying the video game environment to systematically mask different types of visual information that could be used by humans as priors. We find that removal of some prior knowledge causes a drastic degradation in the speed with which human players solve the game, e.g. from 2 minutes to over 20 minutes. Furthermore, our results indicate that general priors, such as the importance of objects and visual consistency, are critical for efficient game-play. Videos and the game manipulations are available at https://rach0012. github.io/humanRL_website/.",,,
3580738,Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2018 LEARNING FROM BETWEEN-CLASS EXAMPLES FOR DEEP SOUND RECOGNITION,"Deep learning methods have achieved high performance in sound recognition tasks. Deciding how to feed the training data is important for further performance improvement. We propose a novel learning method for deep sound recognition: Between-Class learning (BC learning). Our strategy is to learn a discriminative feature space by recognizing the between-class sounds as between-class sounds. We generate between-class sounds by mixing two sounds belonging to different classes with a random ratio. We then input the mixed sound to the model and train the model to output the mixing ratio. The advantages of BC learning are not limited only to the increase in variation of the training data; BC learning leads to an enlargement of Fisher's criterion in the feature space and a regularization of the positional relationship among the feature distributions of the classes. The experimental results show that BC learning improves the performance on various sound recognition networks, datasets, and data augmentation schemes, in which BC learning proves to be always beneficial. Furthermore, we construct a new deep sound recognition network (EnvNet-v2) and train it with BC learning. As a result, we achieved a performance surpasses the human level.",,,
3625614,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017 IMPROVING POLICY GRADIENT BY EXPLORING UNDER-APPRECIATED REWARDS,"This paper presents a novel form of policy gradient for model-free reinforcement learning (RL) with improved exploration properties. Current policy-based methods use entropy regularization to encourage undirected exploration of the reward landscape, which is ineffective in high dimensional spaces with sparse rewards. We propose a more directed exploration strategy that promotes exploration of under-appreciated reward regions. An action sequence is considered under-appreciated if its log-probability under the current policy under-estimates its resulting reward. The proposed exploration strategy is easy to implement, requiring small modifications to the REINFORCE algorithm. We evaluate the approach on a set of algorithmic tasks that have long challenged RL methods. Our approach reduces hyper-parameter sensitivity and demonstrates significant improvements over baseline methods. The proposed algorithm successfully solves a benchmark multi-digit addition task and generalizes to long sequences, which, to our knowledge, is the first time that a pure RL method has solved addition using only reward feedback. * Work done as a member of the Google Brain Residency program (g.co/brainresidency)",,,
3655946,MASKGAN: BETTER TEXT GENERATION VIA FILLING IN THE,"Neural text generation models are often autoregressive language models or seq2seq models. These models generate text by sampling words sequentially, with each word conditioned on the previous word, and are state-of-the-art for several machine translation and summarization benchmarks. These benchmarks are often defined by validation perplexity even though this is not a direct measure of the quality of the generated text. Additionally, these models are typically trained via maximum likelihood and teacher forcing. These methods are well-suited to optimizing perplexity but can result in poor sample quality since generating text requires conditioning on sequences of words that may have never been observed at training time. We propose to improve sample quality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which explicitly train the generator to produce high quality samples and have shown a lot of success in image generation. GANs were originally designed to output differentiable values, so discrete language generation is challenging for them. We claim that validation perplexity alone is not indicative of the quality of text generated by a model. We introduce an actor-critic conditional GAN that fills in missing text conditioned on the surrounding context. We show qualitatively and quantitatively, evidence that this produces more realistic conditional and unconditional text samples compared to a maximum likelihood trained model.",,,

The proposed semiparametric topological memory (SPTM) consists of a (non-parametric) graph with nodes corresponding to locations in the environment and a (parametric) deep network capable of retrieving nodes from the graph based on observations. The graph stores no metric information, only connectivity of locations corresponding to the nodes. We use SPTM as a planning module in a navigation system. Given only 5 minutes of footage of a previously unseen maze, an SPTM-based navigation agent can build a topological map of the environment and use it to confidently navigate towards goals. The average success rate of the SPTM agent in goal-directed navigation across test environments is higher than the best-performing baseline by a factor of three.",,,
3790787,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018 LEARNING APPROXIMATE INFERENCE NETWORKS FOR STRUCTURED PREDICTION,"Structured prediction energy networks (SPENs; Belanger & McCallum 2016) use neural network architectures to define energy functions that can capture arbitrary dependencies among parts of structured outputs. Prior work used gradient descent for inference, relaxing the structured output to a set of continuous variables and then optimizing the energy with respect to them. We replace this use of gradient descent with a neural network trained to approximate structured argmax inference. This ""inference network"" outputs continuous values that we treat as the output structure. We develop large-margin training criteria for joint training of the structured energy function and inference network. On multi-label classification we report speed-ups of 10-60x compared to(Belanger et al., 2017)while also improving accuracy. For sequence labeling with simple structured energies, our approach performs comparably to exact inference while being much faster at test time. We then demonstrate improved accuracy by augmenting the energy with a ""label language model"" that scores entire output label sequences, showing it can improve handling of long-distance dependencies in part-of-speech tagging. Finally, we show how inference networks can replace dynamic programming for test-time inference in conditional random fields, suggestive for their general use for fast inference in structured settings.",,,

We extend this line of work by imposing hyperbolic geometry on the activations of neural networks. This allows us to exploit hyperbolic geometry to reason about embeddings produced by deep networks. We achieve this by re-expressing the ubiquitous mechanism of soft attention in terms of operations defined for hyperboloid and Klein models.

4410570,Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018 FRATERNAL DROPOUT,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) form an important class of architectures among neural networks useful for language modeling and sequential prediction. However, optimizing RNNs is known to be harder compared to feed-forward neural networks. A number of techniques have been proposed in literature to address this problem. In this paper we propose a simple technique called fraternal dropout that takes advantage of dropout to achieve this goal. Specifically, we propose to train two identical copies of an RNN (that share parameters) with different dropout masks while minimizing the difference between their (pre-softmax) predictions. In this way our regularization encourages the representations of RNNs to be invariant to dropout mask, thus being robust. We show that our regularization term is upper bounded by the expectation-linear dropout objective which has been shown to address the gap due to the difference between the train and inference phases of dropout. We evaluate our model and achieve state-of-the-art results in sequence modeling tasks on two benchmark datasets -Penn Treebank and Wikitext-2. We also show that our approach leads to performance improvement by a significant margin in image captioning (Microsoft COCO) and semi-supervised (CIFAR-10) tasks.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018Merity et al. (2017a)andMerity et al. (2017b)on the other hand show that activity regularization (AR) and temporal activation regularization (TAR) 1 are also effective methods for regularizing LSTMs. Another more recent way of regularizing RNNs, that is similar in spirit to the approach we take, involves minimizing the difference between the hidden states of the original and the auxiliary networkSerdyuk et al.

44119895,PeerNets: Exploiting Peer Wisdom Against Adversarial Attacks,"Deep learning systems have become ubiquitous in many aspects of our lives. Unfortunately, it has been shown that such systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, making them prone to potential unlawful and harmful uses. Designing deep neural networks that are robust to adversarial attacks is a fundamental step in making such systems safer and deployable in a broader variety of applications (e.g., autonomous driving), but more importantly is a necessary step to design novel and more advanced architectures built on new computational paradigms rather than marginally modifying existing ones. In this paper we introduce PeerNets, a novel family of convolutional networks alternating classical Euclidean convolutions with graph convolutions to harness information from a graph of peer samples. This results in a form of non-local forward propagation in the model, where latent features are conditioned on the global structure induced by the data graph, that is up to 3× more robust to a variety of white-and black-box adversarial attacks compared to conventional architectures with almost no drop in accuracy.",,,

We test whether RNNs trained with a generic language modeling objective in four languages (Italian, English, Hebrew, Russian) can predict long-distance number agreement in various constructions. We include in our evaluation nonsensical sentences where RNNs cannot rely on semantic or lexical cues (""The colorless green ideas ideas ideas ideas ideas ideas ideas ideas ideas ideas ideas ideas ideas ideas ideas ideas ideas I ate with the chair sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep furiously""), and, for Italian, we compare model performance to human intuitions.

These results suggest that RL methods that use temporal differencing (TD) are superior to direct Monte Carlo estimation (MC). How do these results hold up in deep RL, which deals with perceptually complex environments and deep nonlinear models? In this paper, we re-examine the role of TD in modern deep RL, using specially designed environments that control for specific factors that affect performance, such as reward sparsity, reward delay, and the perceptual complexity of the task. When comparing TD with infinite-horizon MC, we are able to reproduce classic results in modern settings. Yet we also find that finite-horizon MC is not inferior to TD, even when rewards are sparse or delayed. This makes MC a viable alternative to TD in deep RL.",,,

We extend previous work, in which agents were trained in symbolic environments, by developing agents which are able to learn from raw pixel data, a more challenging and realistic input representation. We find that the degree of structure found in the input data affects the nature of the emerged protocols, and thereby corroborate the hypothesis that structured compositional language is most likely to emerge when agents perceive the world as being structured.",,,

The learned sampler generalizes Hamiltonian dynamics with state-dependent drift and diffusion, enabling fast traversal and efficient exploration of neural network energy landscapes. Experiments validate the proposed approach on both Bayesian fully connected neural network and Bayesian recurrent neural network tasks, showing that the learned sampler out-performs generic, handdesigned SG-MCMC algorithms, and generalizes to different datasets and larger architectures.*Equal contribution.",,,
49667762,UNIVERSAL TRANSFORMERS,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) sequentially process data by updating their state with each new data point, and have long been the de facto choice for sequence modeling tasks. However, their inherently sequential computation makes them slow to train. Feed-forward and convolutional architectures have recently been shown to achieve superior results on some sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, with the added advantage that they concurrently process all inputs in the sequence, leading to easy parallelization and faster training times. Despite these successes, however, popular feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer fail to generalize in many simple tasks that recurrent models handle with ease, e.g. copying strings or even simple logical inference when the string or formula lengths exceed those observed at training time. We propose the Universal Transformer (UT), a parallel-in-time self-attentive recurrent sequence model which can be cast as a generalization of the Transformer model and which addresses these issues. UTs combine the parallelizability and global receptive field of feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer with the recurrent inductive bias of RNNs. We also add a dynamic per-position halting mechanism and find that it improves accuracy on several tasks. In contrast to the standard Transformer, under certain assumptions UTs can be shown to be Turing-complete. Our experiments show that UTs outperform standard Transformers on a wide range of algorithmic and language understanding tasks, including the challenging LAMBADA language modeling task where UTs achieve a new state of the art, and machine translation where UTs achieve a 0.9 BLEU improvement over Transformers on the WMT14 En-De dataset. * Equal contribution, alphabetically by last name. † Work performed while at Google Brain.",,,

While recent approaches have achieved state-of-the-art predictive performance for image recognition, they are problematic under resource constraints for two reasons: (1) the neural architectures found are solely optimized for high predictive performance, without penalizing excessive resource consumption; (2) most architecture search methods require vast computational resources. We address the first shortcoming by proposing LEMONADE, an evolutionary algorithm for multi-objective architecture search that allows approximating the entire Pareto-front of architectures under multiple objectives, such as predictive performance and number of parameters, in a single run of the method. We address the second shortcoming by proposing a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism for LEMONADE which generates children networks that are warmstarted with the predictive performance of their trained parents. This is accomplished by using (approximate) network morphism operators for generating children. The combination of these two contributions allows finding models that are on par or even outperform both hand-crafted as well as automatically-designed networks.",,,

Despite lacking trainable recurrent layers, stacked QRNNs have better predictive accuracy than stacked LSTMs of the same hidden size.

But a question remains: can these efficient representations be learned using current deep learning techniques? In this work, we test whether standard deep learning methods can in fact find the efficient representations posited by several theories of deep representation. Specifically, we train deep neural networks to learn two simple functions with known efficient solutions: the parity function and the fast Fourier transform. We find that using gradient-based optimization, a deep network does not learn the parity function, unless initialized very close to a hand-coded exact solution. We also find that a deep linear neural network does not learn the fast Fourier transform, even in the best-case scenario of infinite training data, unless the weights are initialized very close to the exact hand-coded solution. Our results suggest that not every element of the class of compositional functions can be learned efficiently by a deep network, and further restrictions are necessary to understand what functions are both efficiently representable and learnable.",,,

Typical methods formulate an input as a document graph, integrating various intra-sentential and inter-sentential dependencies. The current state-of-the-art method splits the input graph into two DAGs, adopting a DAG-structured LSTM for each. Though being able to model rich linguistic knowledge by leveraging graph edges, important information can be lost in the splitting procedure. We propose a graph-state LSTM model, which uses a parallel state to model each word, recurrently enriching state values via message passing. Compared with DAG LSTMs, our graph LSTM keeps the original graph structure, and speeds up computation by allowing more parallelization.

Reassessing Claims of Human Parity in Neural Machine Translation,"We reassess a recent study(Hassan et al., 2018)that claimed that machine translation (MT) has reached human parity for the translation of news from Chinese into English, using pairwise ranking and considering three variables that were not taken into account in that previous study: the language in which the source side of the test set was originally written, the translation proficiency of the evaluators, and the provision of inter-sentential context. If we consider only original source text (i.e. not translated from another language, or translationese), then we find evidence showing that human parity has not been achieved. We compare the judgments of professional translators against those of non-experts and discover that those of the experts result in higher inter-annotator agreement and better discrimination between human and machine translations. In addition, we analyse the human translations of the test set and identify important translation issues. Finally, based on these findings, we provide a set of recommendations for future human evaluations of MT.",,,

And if such inputs exist, how to find them efficiently. We adopt an empirical methodology, in which we first create lists of egregious output sequences, and then design a discrete optimization algorithm to find input sequences that will cause the model to generate them. Moreover, the optimization algorithm is enhanced for large vocabulary search and constrained to search for input sequences that are likely to be input by real-world users. In our experiments, we apply this approach to dialogue response generation models trained on three real-world dialogue data-sets: Ubuntu, Switchboard and OpenSubtitles, testing whether the model can generate malicious responses.

Unlike for images, a barrier to success is that the best discriminative representations for audio tend to be non-invertible, and thus cannot be used to synthesize listenable outputs. In this paper we introduce WaveGAN, a first attempt at applying GANs to unsupervised synthesis of raw-waveform audio. Our experiments demonstrate that WaveGAN can produce intelligible words from a small vocabulary of speech, and can also synthesize audio from other domains such as drums, bird vocalizations, and piano. Qualitatively, we find that human judges prefer the sound quality of generated examples from WaveGAN over those from a method which naïvely apply GANs on image-like audio feature representations.",,,
52893258,ON THE UNIVERSAL APPROXIMABILITY AND COMPLEXITY BOUNDS OF QUANTIZED RELU NEURAL NETWORKS,"Compression is a key step to deploy large neural networks on resource-constrained platforms. As a popular compression technique, quantization constrains the number of distinct weight values and thus reducing the number of bits required to represent and store each weight. In this paper, we study the representation power of quantized neural networks. First, we prove the universal approximability of quantized ReLU networks on a wide class of functions. Then we provide upper bounds on the number of weights and the memory size for a given approximation error bound and the bit-width of weights for function-independent and functiondependent structures. Our results reveal that, to attain an approximation error bound of , the number of weights needed by a quantized network is no more than O log 5 (1/ ) times that of an unquantized network. This overhead is of much lower order than the lower bound of the number of weights needed for the error bound, supporting the empirical success of various quantization techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on the complexity bounds of quantized neural networks.1",,,

We discuss the difficulty of generalizing such adaptive schemes to the most agnostic Riemannian setting, and then provide algorithms and convergence proofs for geodesically convex objectives in the particular case of a product of Riemannian manifolds, in which adaptivity is implemented across manifolds in the cartesian product. Our generalization is tight in the sense that choosing the Euclidean space as Riemannian manifold yields the same algorithms and regret bounds as those that were already known for the standard algorithms. Experimentally, we show faster convergence and to a lower train loss value for Riemannian adaptive methods over their corresponding baselines on the realistic task of embedding the WordNet taxonomy in the Poincaré ball.arXiv:1810.00760v1 [cs.LG] 1 Oct 2018Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019Our contributions. In this work we (i) explain why generalizing these adaptive schemes to the most agnostic Riemannian setting in an intrinsic manner is compromised, and (ii) propose generalizations of the algorithms together with their convergence analysis in the particular case of a product of manifolds where each manifold represents one ""coordinate"" of the adaptive scheme. Finally, we (iii) empirically support our claims on the realistic task of hyperbolic taxonomy embedding.Our initial motivation. The particular application that motivated us in developing Riemannian versions of ADAGRAD and ADAM was the learning of symbolic embeddings in non-Euclidean spaces. As an example, the GloVe algorithm(Pennington et al., 2014)− an unsupervised method for learning Euclidean word embeddings capturing semantic/syntactic relationships − benefits significantly from optimizing with ADAGRAD compared to using SGD, presumably because different words are sampled at different frequencies. Hence the absence of Riemannian adaptive algorithms could constitute a significant obstacle to the development of competitive optimization-based Riemannian embedding methods. In particular, we believe that the recent rise of embedding methods in hyperbolic spaces",,,
52909341,NEAR-OPTIMAL REPRESENTATION LEARNING FOR HIERARCHICAL REINFORCEMENT LEARNING,"We study the problem of representation learning in goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning. In such hierarchical structures, a higher-level controller solves tasks by iteratively communicating goals which a lower-level policy is trained to reach. Accordingly, the choice of representation -the mapping of observation space to goal space -is crucial. To study this problem, we develop a notion of sub-optimality of a representation, defined in terms of expected reward of the optimal hierarchical policy using this representation. We derive expressions which bound the sub-optimality and show how these expressions can be translated to representation learning objectives which may be optimized in practice. Results on a number of difficult continuous-control tasks show that our approach to representation learning yields qualitatively better representations as well as quantitatively better hierarchical policies, compared to existing methods. 1",,,
52909749,OPTIMAL COMPLETION DISTILLATION FOR SEQUENCE LEARNING,"We present Optimal Completion Distillation (OCD), a training procedure for optimizing sequence to sequence models based on edit distance. OCD is efficient, has no hyper-parameters of its own, and does not require pretraining or joint optimization with conditional log-likelihood. Given a partial sequence generated by the model, we first identify the set of optimal suffixes that minimize the total edit distance, using an efficient dynamic programming algorithm. Then, for each position of the generated sequence, we use a target distribution that puts equal probability on the first token of all the optimal suffixes. OCD achieves the state-ofthe-art performance on end-to-end speech recognition, on both Wall Street Journal and Librispeech datasets, achieving 9.3% WER and 4.5% WER respectively.",,,
52920181,EPISODIC CURIOSITY THROUGH REACHABILITY,"Rewards are sparse in the real world and most today's reinforcement learning algorithms struggle with such sparsity. One solution to this problem is to allow the agent to create rewards for itself -thus making rewards dense and more suitable for learning. In particular, inspired by curious behaviour in animals, observing something novel could be rewarded with a bonus. Such bonus is summed up with the real task reward -making it possible for RL algorithms to learn from the combined reward. We propose a new curiosity method which uses episodic memory to form the novelty bonus. To determine the bonus, the current observation is compared with the observations in memory. Crucially, the comparison is done based on how many environment steps it takes to reach the current observation from those in memory -which incorporates rich information about environment dynamics. This allows us to overcome the known ""couch-potato"" issues of prior work -when the agent finds a way to instantly gratify itself by exploiting actions which lead to hardly predictable consequences. We test our approach in visually rich 3D environments in VizDoom, DMLab and MuJoCo. In navigational tasks from VizDoom and DMLab, our agent outperforms the state-of-the-art curiosity method ICM. In MuJoCo, an ant equipped with our curiosity module learns locomotion out of the first-person-view curiosity only. * Shared first authorship.",,,
52938034,LEARNING CONCISE REPRESENTATIONS FOR REGRES- SION BY EVOLVING NETWORKS OF TREES,"We propose and study a method for learning interpretable representations for the task of regression. Features are represented as networks of multi-type expression trees comprised of activation functions common in neural networks in addition to other elementary functions. Differentiable features are trained via gradient descent, and the performance of features in a linear model is used to weight the rate of change among subcomponents of each representation. The search process maintains an archive of representations with accuracy-complexity trade-offs to assist in generalization and interpretation. We compare several stochastic optimization approaches within this framework. We benchmark these variants on 100 open-source regression problems in comparison to state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. Our main finding is that this approach produces the highest average test scores across problems while producing representations that are orders of magnitude smaller than the next best performing method (gradient boosting). We also report a negative result in which attempts to directly optimize the disentanglement of the representation result in more highly correlated features. that offer insight by virtue of their simplicity, in a similar vein to models built from first-principles (e.g.(Tibshirani, 1996;Schmidt & Lipson, 2009)). Akin to the latter group, our goal is to discover the simplest description of a process whose predictions generalize as well as possible.Good representations should also disentangle the factors of variation(Bengio et al., 2013)in the data, in order to ease model interpretation. Disentanglement implies functional modularity; i.e., sub-components of the network should encapsulate behaviors that model a sub-process of the task. In this sense, stochastic methods such as evolutionary computation (EC) appear well-motivated, as they are premised on the identification and propagation of building blocks of solutions(Holland, 1975). Experiments with EC applied to networks suggest it pressures networks to be modular(Huizinga et al., 2014;Kashtan & Alon, 2005). Although the identification functional building blocks of solutions sounds ideal, we have no way of knowing a priori whether a given problem will admit the identification of building blocks of solutions via heuristic search(Oppacher, 2014). Our goal in this paper is thus to empirically assess the performance of several SO approaches in a system designed to produce intelligible representations from NN building blocks for regression.In Section 2, we introduce a new method for optimizing representations that we call the feature engineering automation tool (FEAT) 1 . The purpose of this method is to optimize an archive of representations that characterize the trade-off between conciseness and accuracy among representations. Algorithmically, two aspects of the method distinguish FEAT from previous work. First, it represents the internal structure of each NN as a set of syntax trees, with the goal of improving the transparency of the resultant representations. Second, it uses weights learned via gradient descent to provide feedback to the variation process at a more granular level. We compare several multi-objective variants of this approach using EC and non-EC methods with different sets of objectives.We discuss related work in more detail in Section 3. In section 4 and 5, we describe and conduct an experiment that benchmarks FEAT against state-of-the-art ML methods on 100 open-source regression problems. Future work based on this analysis is discussed in Section 6, and additional detailed results are provided in the Appendix.",,,
52944914,Deep Decoder: Concise Image Representations from Untrained Non-convolutional Networks,"Deep neural networks, in particular convolutional neural networks, have become highly effective tools for compressing images and solving inverse problems including denoising, inpainting, and reconstruction from few and noisy measurements. This success can be attributed in part to their ability to represent and generate natural images well. Contrary to classical tools such as wavelets, image-generating deep neural networks have a large number of parameters-typically a multiple of their output dimension-and need to be trained on large datasets. In this paper, we propose an untrained simple image model, called the deep decoder, which is a deep neural network that can generate natural images from very few weight parameters. The deep decoder has a simple architecture with no convolutions and fewer weight parameters than the output dimensionality. This underparameterization enables the deep decoder to compress images into a concise set of network weights, which we show is on par with wavelet-based thresholding. Further, underparameterization provides a barrier to overfitting, allowing the deep decoder to have state-of-the-art performance for denoising. The deep decoder is simple in the sense that each layer has an identical structure that consists of only one upsampling unit, pixel-wise linear combination of channels, ReLU activation, and channelwise normalization. This simplicity makes the network amenable to theoretical analysis, and it sheds light on the aspects of neural networks that enable them to form effective signal representations.",,,
52947902,textTOvec: DEEP CONTEXTUALIZED NEURAL AUTOREGRESSIVE TOPIC MODELS OF LANGUAGE WITH DISTRIBUTED COMPOSITIONAL PRIOR,"We address two challenges of probabilistic topic modelling in order to better estimate the probability of a word in a given context, i.e., P (word|context) : (1) No language structure in context: Probabilistic topic models ignore word order by summarizing a given context as a ""bag-of-word"" and consequently the semantics of words in the context is lost. In this work, we incorporate language structure by combining a neural autoregressive topic model (TM) (e.g., DocNADE) with a LSTM based language model (LSTM-LM) in a single probabilistic framework. The LSTM-LM learns a vector-space representation of each word by accounting for word order in local collocation patterns, while the TM simultaneously learns a latent representation from the entire document. In addition, the LSTM-LM models complex characteristics of language (e.g., syntax and semantics), while the TM discovers the underlying thematic structure in a collection of documents. We unite two complementary paradigms of learning the meaning of word occurrences by combining a topic model and a language model in a unified probabilistic framework, named as ctx-DocNADE. (2) Limited context and/or smaller training corpus of documents: In settings with a small number of word occurrences (i.e., lack of context) in short text or data sparsity in a corpus of few documents, the application of TMs is challenging. We address this challenge by incorporating external knowledge into neural autoregressive topic models via a language modelling approach: we use word embeddings as input of a LSTM-LM with the aim to improve the word-topic mapping on a smaller and/or short-text corpus. The proposed Doc-NADE extension is named as ctx-DocNADEe. We present novel neural autoregressive topic model variants coupled with neural language models and embeddings priors that consistently outperform state-of-theart generative topic models in terms of generalization (perplexity), interpretability (topic coherence) and applicability (retrieval and classification) over 7 long-text and 8 short-text datasets from diverse domains.",,,
52967399,BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding,"We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be finetuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial taskspecific architecture modifications.BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).Mandar Joshi, Eunsol Choi, Daniel S Weld, and Luke  Zettlemoyer. 2017.

53015027,ADAPTIVITY OF DEEP RELU NETWORK FOR LEARN- ING IN BESOV AND MIXED SMOOTH BESOV SPACES: OPTIMAL RATE AND CURSE OF DIMENSIONALITY,"Deep learning has shown high performances in various types of tasks from visual recognition to natural language processing, which indicates superior flexibility and adaptivity of deep learning. To understand this phenomenon theoretically, we develop a new approximation and estimation error analysis of deep learning with the ReLU activation for functions in a Besov space and its variant with mixed smoothness. The Besov space is a considerably general function space including the Hölder space and Sobolev space, and especially can capture spatial inhomogeneity of smoothness. Through the analysis in the Besov space, it is shown that deep learning can achieve the minimax optimal rate and outperform any nonadaptive (linear) estimator such as kernel ridge regression, which shows that deep learning has higher adaptivity to the spatial inhomogeneity of the target function than other estimators such as linear ones. In addition to this, it is shown that deep learning can avoid the curse of dimensionality if the target function is in a mixed smooth Besov space. We also show that the dependency of the convergence rate on the dimensionality is tight due to its minimax optimality. These results support high adaptivity of deep learning and its superior ability as a feature extractor.",,,
53208122,LANGUAGE GANS FALLING SHORT,"Traditional natural language generation (NLG) models are trained using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) which differs from the sample generation inference procedure. During training the ground truth tokens are passed to the model, however, during inference, the model instead reads its previously generated samples -a phenomenon coined exposure bias. Exposure bias was hypothesized to be a root cause of poor sample quality and thus many generative adversarial networks (GANs) were proposed as a remedy since they have identical training and inference. However, many of the ensuing GAN variants validated sample quality improvements but ignored loss of sample diversity. This work reiterates the fallacy of quality-only metrics and clearly demonstrate that the well-established technique of reducing softmax temperature can outperform GANs on a quality-only metric. Further, we establish a definitive quality-diversity evaluation procedure using temperature tuning over local and global sample metrics. Under this, we find that MLE models consistently outperform the proposed GAN variants over the whole quality-diversity space. Specifically, we find that 1) exposure bias appears to be less of an issue than the complications arising from non-differentiable, sequential GAN training; 2) MLE trained models provide a better quality/diversity tradeoff compared to their GAN counterparts, all while being easier to train, easier to cross-validate, and less computationally expensive. 1 * Authors contributed equally 1 Code to reproduce experiments is available at github.com/pclucas14/GansFallingShort",,,
53327717,DEEP FRANK-WOLFE FOR NEURAL NETWORK OPTIMIZATION,"Learning a deep neural network requires solving a challenging optimization problem: it is a high-dimensional, non-convex and non-smooth minimization problem with a large number of terms. The current practice in neural network optimization is to rely on the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm or its adaptive variants. However, SGD requires a hand-designed schedule for the learning rate. In addition, its adaptive variants tend to produce solutions that generalize less well on unseen data than SGD with a hand-designed schedule. We present an optimization method that offers empirically the best of both worlds: our algorithm yields good generalization performance while requiring only one hyper-parameter. Our approach is based on a composite proximal framework, which exploits the compositional nature of deep neural networks and can leverage powerful convex optimization algorithms by design. Specifically, we employ the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm for SVM, which computes an optimal step-size in closed-form at each time-step. We further show that the descent direction is given by a simple backward pass in the network, yielding the same computational cost per iteration as SGD. We present experiments on the CIFAR and SNLI data sets, where we demonstrate the significant superiority of our method over Adam, Adagrad, as well as the recently proposed BPGrad and AMSGrad. Furthermore, we compare our algorithm to SGD with a hand-designed learning rate schedule, and show that it provides similar generalization while converging faster.

However, they have not been well visualized or understood. How does a GAN represent our visual world internally? What causes the artifacts in GAN results? How do architectural choices affect GAN learning? Answering such questions could enable us to develop new insights and better models. In this work, we present an analytic framework to visualize and understand GANs at the unit-, object-, and scene-level. We first identify a group of interpretable units that are closely related to object concepts using a segmentation-based network dissection method. Then, we quantify the causal effect of interpretable units by measuring the ability of interventions to control objects in the output. We examine the contextual relationship between these units and their surroundings by inserting the discovered object concepts into new images. We show several practical applications enabled by our framework, from comparing internal representations across different layers, models, and datasets, to improving GANs by locating and removing artifact-causing units, to interactively manipulating objects in a scene. We provide open source interpretation tools to help researchers and practitioners better understand their GAN models * . * Interactive demos, video, code, and data are available at GitHub and gandissect.",,,
53951481,CAVEATS FOR INFORMATION BOTTLENECK IN DETERMINISTIC SCENARIOS,"Information bottleneck (IB) is a method for extracting information from one random variable X that is relevant for predicting another random variable Y . To do so, IB identifies an intermediate ""bottleneck"" variable T that has low mutual information I(X; T ) and high mutual information I(Y ; T ). The IB curve characterizes the set of bottleneck variables that achieve maximal I(Y ; T ) for a given I(X; T ), and is typically explored by maximizing the IB Lagrangian, I(Y ; T ) − βI(X; T ). In some cases, Y is a deterministic function of X, including many classification problems in supervised learning where the output class Y is a deterministic function of the input X. We demonstrate three caveats when using IB in any situation where Y is a deterministic function of X: (1) the IB curve cannot be recovered by maximizing the IB Lagrangian for different values of β; (2) there are ""uninteresting"" trivial solutions at all points of the IB curve; and (3) for multi-layer classifiers that achieve low prediction error, different layers cannot exhibit a strict trade-off between compression and prediction, contrary to a recent proposal. We also show that when Y is a small perturbation away from being a deterministic function of X, these three caveats arise in an approximate way. To address problem (1), we propose a functional that, unlike the IB Lagrangian, can recover the IB curve in all cases. We demonstrate the three caveats on the MNIST dataset. * Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2019 where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter that controls the trade-off between compression and prediction. The advantage of optimizing L β IB is that it avoids the non-linear constraint in Eq. (1) 1 . Several recent papers have drawn connections between IB and supervised learning, in particular classification using neural networks.

In this paper, we present SDP-LSTM, a novel neural network to classify the relation of two entities in a sentence. Our neural architecture leverages the shortest dependency path (SDP) between two entities; multichannel recurrent neural networks, with long short term memory (LSTM) units, pick up heterogeneous information along the SDP. Our proposed model has several distinct features: (1) The shortest dependency paths retain most relevant information (to relation classification), while eliminating irrelevant words in the sentence. (2) The multichannel LSTM networks allow effective information integration from heterogeneous sources over the dependency paths.(3) A customized dropout strategy regularizes the neural network to alleviate overfitting. We test our model on the SemEval 2010 relation classification task, and achieve an F 1 -score of 83.7%, higher than competing methods in the literature.",,,
54438210,,"Neural architecture search (NAS) has a great impact by automatically designing effective neural network architectures.However, the prohibitive computational demand of conventional NAS algorithms (e.g. 10 4 GPU hours) makes it difficult to directly search the architectures on large-scale tasks (e.g.ImageNet).Differentiable NAS can reduce the cost of GPU hours via a continuous representation of network architecture but suffers from the high GPU memory consumption issue (grow linearly w.r.t.candidate set size).As a result, they need to utilize proxy tasks, such as training on a smaller dataset, or learning with only a few blocks, or training just for a few epochs.These architectures optimized on proxy tasks are not guaranteed to be optimal on the target task.In this paper, we present ProxylessNAS that can directly learn the architectures for large-scale target tasks and target hardware platforms.We address the high memory consumption issue of differentiable NAS and reduce the computational cost (GPU hours and GPU memory) to the same level of regular training while still allowing a large candidate set.Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of directness and specialization.On CIFAR-10, our model achieves 2.08% test error with only 5.7M parameters, better than the previous state-of-the-art architecture AmoebaNet-B, while using 6× fewer parameters.On ImageNet, our model achieves 3.1% better top-1 accuracy than MobileNetV2, while being 1.2× faster with measured GPU latency.We also apply ProxylessNAS to specialize neural architectures for hardware with direct hardware metrics (e.g.latency) and provide insights for efficient CNN architecture design. 1",,,

The FrameNet data provide an extensive body of ""gold standard"" data that can be used in lexical semantics research, as the basis for its further exploitation in NLP applications. Eight teams participated in the task, with a total of 20 runs. Discussions among participants during development of the task and the scoring of their runs contributed to a successful task. Participants used a wide variety of techniques, investigating many aspects of the FrameNet data. They achieved results showing considerable improvements from Gildea and Jurafsky's baseline study.

57145,Using Answer Set Programming in an Inference-Based approach to Natural Language Semantics,"MotivationThe traditional tri-partition syntax/semantics/pragmatics is commonly used in most of the computer systems that aim at the simulation of the human understanding of Natural Language (NL). This conception does not reflect the flexible and creative manner that humans use in reality to interpret texts. Generally speaking, formal NL semantics is referential i.e. it assumes that it is possible to create a static discourse universe and to equate the objects of this universe to the (static) meanings of words. The meaning of a sentence is then built from the meanings of the words in a compositional process and the semantic interpretation of a sentence is reduced to its logical interpretation based on the truth conditions. The very difficult task of adapting the meaning of a sentence to its context is often left to the pragmatic level, and this task requires to use a huge amount of common sense knowledge about the domain. This approach is seriously challenged (see for example [4][14]). It has been showed that the above tri-partition is very artificial because linguistic as well as extra-linguistic knowledge interact in the same global process to provide the necessary elements for understanding. Linguistic phenomena such as polysemy, plurals, metaphors and shifts in meaning create real difficulties to the referential approach of the NL semantics discussed above. As an alternative solution to these problems,[4]proposes an inferential approach to the NL semantics in which words trigger inferences depending on the context of their apparition. In the same spirit we claim that understanding a NL text is a reasoning process based on our knowledge about the norms 1 of its domain i.e. what we generally expect to happen in normal situations. But what kind of reasoning is needed for natural language semantics?The answer to this question is based on the remark that texts seldom provide normal details that are assumed to be known to the reader. Instead, they focus on abnormal situations or at least on events that cannot be inferred by default from the text by an ordinary reader. A central issue in the human understanding of NL is the ability to infer systematically and easily an amount of implicit information necessary to answer indirect questions about the text. The consequences resulting from truth-based entailments are logically valid but they are poor and quite limited. Those obtained by a norm-based approach are defeasible: they are admitted as long as the text does not mention explicit elements that contradict them. However they provide richer information and enable a deeper understanding of the text. That is why the norm-based reasoning must be non-monotonic. In addition to this central question, the representation language must take into account a number of modalities (including the temporal aspect) that are very useful to answer different questions on NL texts.The next section gives a general logical framework to represent in a first order language the necessary knowledge about a domain and allows non-monotonic reasoning. Section 3 shows how to implement our representation language fragment in the formalism of Answer Set Programming by transforming them into extended logic programs. In section 4, we discuss the use of our language in 1 In A.I, the word norm is commonly used in the « normative » sens. Here, it is rather used in the « normal » sens.",,,

In spite of their relevance, the computational properties of these alternatives have not yet been fully explored. We study the computational power of two of the most paradigmatic architectures exemplifying these mechanisms: the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) and the Neural GPU (Kaiser & Sutskever, 2016). We show both models to be Turing complete exclusively based on their capacity to compute and access internal dense representations of the data. In particular, neither the Transformer nor the Neural GPU requires access to an external memory to become Turing complete. Our study also reveals some minimal sets of elements needed to obtain these completeness results.",,,
5834589,ON LARGE-BATCH TRAINING FOR DEEP LEARNING: GENERALIZATION GAP AND SHARP MINIMA,"The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method and its variants are algorithms of choice for many Deep Learning tasks. These methods operate in a small-batch regime wherein a fraction of the training data, say 32-512 data points, is sampled to compute an approximation to the gradient. It has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. We investigate the cause for this generalization drop in the large-batch regime and present numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions-and as is well known, sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. In contrast, small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise in the gradient estimation. We discuss several strategies to attempt to help large-batch methods eliminate this generalization gap.

We show that each variant of data noising is an instance of Bayesian recurrent neural networks with a particular variational distribution (i.e., a mixture of Gaussians whose weights depend on statistics derived from the corpus such as the unigram distribution). We use this insight to propose a more principled method to apply at prediction time and propose natural extensions to data noising under the variational framework. In particular, we propose variational smoothing with tied input and output embedding matrices and an element-wise variational smoothing method. We empirically verify our analysis on two benchmark language modeling datasets and demonstrate performance improvements over existing data noising methods.",,,
5882977,TOWARDS UNIVERSAL PARAPHRASTIC SENTENCE EMBEDDINGS,"We consider the problem of learning general-purpose, paraphrastic sentence embeddings based on supervision from the Paraphrase Database(Ganitkevitch et al., 2013). We compare six compositional architectures, evaluating them on annotated textual similarity datasets drawn both from the same distribution as the training data and from a wide range of other domains. We find that the most complex architectures, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks, perform best on the in-domain data. However, in out-of-domain scenarios, simple architectures such as word averaging vastly outperform LSTMs. Our simplest averaging model is even competitive with systems tuned for the particular tasks while also being extremely efficient and easy to use. In order to better understand how these architectures compare, we conduct further experiments on three supervised NLP tasks: sentence similarity, entailment, and sentiment classification. We again find that the word averaging models perform well for sentence similarity and entailment, outperforming LSTMs. However, on sentiment classification, we find that the LSTM performs very strongly-even recording new state-of-the-art performance on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank. We then demonstrate how to combine our pretrained sentence embeddings with these supervised tasks, using them both as a prior and as a black box feature extractor. This leads to performance rivaling the state of the art on the SICK similarity and entailment tasks. We release all of our resources to the research community 1 with the hope that they can serve as the new baseline for further work on universal sentence embeddings.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2016 2 We used the publicly available 300-dimensional vectors that were trained on the 840 billion token Common Crawl corpus, available at http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/.3 These are 300-dimensional vectors fromWieting et al.

588327,Learning Structures of Negations from Flat Annotations,"We propose a novel method to learn negation expressions in a specialized (medical) domain. In our corpus, negations are annotated as 'flat' text spans. This allows for some infelicities in the mark-up of the ground truth, making it less than perfectly aligned with the underlying syntactic structure. Nonetheless, the negations thus captured are correct in intent, and thus potentially valuable. We succeed in training a model for detecting the negated predicates corresponding to the annotated negations, by re-mapping the corpus to anchor its 'flat' annotation spans into the predicate argument structure. Our key idea-re-mapping the negation instance spans to more uniform syntactic nodes-makes it possible to re-frame the learning task as a simpler one, and to leverage an imperfect resource in a way which enables us to learn a high performance model. We achieve high accuracy for negation detection overall, 87%. Our re-mapping scheme can be constructively applied to existing flatly annotated resources for other tasks where syntactic context is vital.",,,

Empirically, we demonstrate stable recurrent models often perform as well as their unstable counterparts on benchmark sequence tasks. Taken together, these findings shed light on the effective power of recurrent networks and suggest much of sequence learning happens, or can be made to happen, in the stable regime. Moreover, our results help to explain why in many cases practitioners succeed in replacing recurrent models by feed-forward models. *",,,

Drawing inspiration from human societies, in which successful coordination of many individuals is often facilitated by hierarchical organisation, we introduce Feudal Multiagent Hierarchies (FMH). In this framework, a 'manager' agent, which is tasked with maximising the environmentally-determined reward function, learns to communicate subgoals to multiple, simultaneously-operating, 'worker' agents. Workers, which are rewarded for achieving managerial subgoals, take concurrent actions in the world. We outline the structure of FMH and demonstrate its potential for decentralised learning and control. We find that, given an adequate set of subgoals from which to choose, FMH performs, and particularly scales, substantially better than cooperative approaches that use a shared reward function.",,,
59317031,FIXUP INITIALIZATION: RESIDUAL LEARNING WITHOUT NORMALIZATION,"Normalization layers are a staple in state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures. They are widely believed to stabilize training, enable higher learning rate, accelerate convergence and improve generalization, though the reason for their effectiveness is still an active research topic. In this work, we challenge the commonly-held beliefs by showing that none of the perceived benefits is unique to normalization. Specifically, we propose fixed-update initialization (Fixup), an initialization motivated by solving the exploding and vanishing gradient problem at the beginning of training via properly rescaling a standard initialization. We find training residual networks with Fixup to be as stable as training with normalization -even for networks with 10,000 layers. Furthermore, with proper regularization, Fixup enables residual networks without normalization to achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification and machine translation. Despite the enormous empirical success of training deep networks with normalization, and recent progress on understanding the working of batch normalization(Santurkar et al., 2018), there is currently no general consensus on why these normalization techniques help training residual neural networks. Intrigued by this topic, in this work we study (i) without normalization, can a deep residual network be trained reliably? (And if so,) (ii) without normalization, can a deep residual network be trained with the same learning rate, converge at the same speed, and generalize equally well (or even better)?Perhaps surprisingly, we find the answers to both questions are Yes. In particular, we show:• Why normalization helps training. We derive a lower bound for the gradient norm of a residual network at initialization, which explains why with standard initializations, normalization techniques are essential for training deep residual networks at maximal learning rate.

Our aim is to put sentence embeddings on more solid footing by 1) looking at how much modern sentence embeddings gain over random methods-as it turns out, surprisingly little; and by 2) providing the field with more appropriate baselines going forward-which are, as it turns out, quite strong. We also make important observations about proper experimental protocol for sentence classification evaluation, together with recommendations for future research. * Work done as an intern at Facebook AI Research. 1 Code available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/randsent. We go down a well-paved avenue of exploration in the machine learning research community, and exploit an insight originally due to Cover (1965): ""A complex pattern-classification problem, cast in a high-dimensional space nonlinearly, is more likely to be linearly separable than in a lowdimensional space, provided that the space is not densely populated."" That is, we examine three types of models for obtaining randomly computed sentence representations from pre-trained word embeddings: bag of random embedding projections, randomly initialized recurrent networks and echo state networks.Our goal is not to obtain a new state of the art, but to put current state of the art methods on more solid footing by 1) looking at how much they gain compared to random methods; and 2) providing the field with more solid baselines going forward.

59551640,SELF-TUNING NETWORKS: BILEVEL OPTIMIZATION OF HYPERPARAMETERS US- ING STRUCTURED BEST-RESPONSE FUNCTIONS,"Hyperparameter optimization can be formulated as a bilevel optimization problem, where the optimal parameters on the training set depend on the hyperparameters. We aim to adapt regularization hyperparameters for neural networks by fitting compact approximations to the best-response function, which maps hyperparameters to optimal weights and biases. We show how to construct scalable best-response approximations for neural networks by modeling the best-response as a single network whose hidden units are gated conditionally on the regularizer. We justify this approximation by showing the exact best-response for a shallow linear network with L 2 -regularized Jacobian can be represented by a similar gating mechanism. We fit this model using a gradient-based hyperparameter optimization algorithm which alternates between approximating the best-response around the current hyperparameters and optimizing the hyperparameters using the approximate best-response function. Unlike other gradient-based approaches, we do not require differentiating the training loss with respect to the hyperparameters, allowing us to tune discrete hyperparameters, data augmentation hyperparameters, and dropout probabilities. Because the hyperparameters are adapted online, our approach discovers hyperparameter schedules that can outperform fixed hyperparameter values. Empirically, our approach outperforms competing hyperparameter optimization methods on large-scale deep learning problems. We call our networks, which update their own hyperparameters online during training, Self-Tuning Networks (STNs). * Equal contribution. 1  The uniqueness of the arg min is assumed. .

5999791,Making Sense of Word Embeddings,"We present a simple yet effective approach for learning word sense embeddings. In contrast to existing techniques, which either directly learn sense representations from corpora or rely on sense inventories from lexical resources, our approach can induce a sense inventory from existing word embeddings via clustering of ego-networks of related words. An integrated WSD mechanism enables labeling of words in context with learned sense vectors, which gives rise to downstream applications. Experiments show that the performance of our method is comparable to state-of-the-art unsupervised WSD systems.Related WorkOur method learns multi-prototype word embeddings and applies them to WSD. Below we briefly review both strains of research.Multi-Prototype Word Vector SpacesIn his pioneering work, Schütze (1998) induced sparse sense vectors by clustering context vectors using the EM algorithm. This approach is fitted with a similarity-based WSD mechanism. Later, Reisinger and Mooney (2010) presented a multiprototype vector space. Sparse TF-IDF vectors are clustered using a parametric method fixing the same number of senses for all words. Sense vectors are centroids of the clusters.While most dense word vector models represent a word with a single vector and thus conflate senses(Mikolov et al., 2013;Pennington et al., 2014), there are several approaches that produce word sense embeddings.

6212000,UNDERSTANDING DEEP LEARNING REQUIRES RE- THINKING GENERALIZATION,"Despite their massive size, successful deep artificial neural networks can exhibit a remarkably small difference between training and test performance. Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.",,,

Existing work has also neglected to consider the constraints that the incremental process of language acquisition must place on the structure of semantic memory. Here we present a model that incrementally updates a semantic network, with limited computational steps, and replicates many patterns found in human semantic fluency using a simple random walk. We also perform thorough analyses showing that a combination of both structural and semantic features are correlated with human performance patterns.",,,

67855552,ON THE SENSITIVITY OF ADVERSARIAL ROBUSTNESS TO INPUT DATA DISTRIBUTIONS,"Neural networks are vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations. Existing literature largely focused on understanding and mitigating the vulnerability of learned models. In this paper, we demonstrate an intriguing phenomenon about the most popular robust training method in the literature, adversarial training: Adversarial robustness, unlike clean accuracy, is sensitive to the input data distribution. Even a semantics-preserving transformations on the input data distribution can cause a significantly different robustness for the adversarial trained model that is both trained and evaluated on the new distribution. Our discovery of such sensitivity on data distribution is based on a study which disentangles the behaviors of clean accuracy and robust accuracy of the Bayes classifier. Empirical investigations further confirm our finding. We construct semantically-identical variants for MNIST and CIFAR10 respectively, and show that standardly trained models achieve comparable clean accuracies on them, but adversarially trained models achieve significantly different robustness accuracies. This counter-intuitive phenomenon indicates that input data distribution alone can affect the adversarial robustness of trained neural networks, not necessarily the tasks themselves. Lastly, we discuss the practical implications on evaluating adversarial robustness, and make initial attempts to understand this complex phenomenon.A semantically-lossless shift on the data distribution could result in a drastically different robustness for adversarially trained models.Note that this is different from the transferability of a fixed model that is trained on one data distribution but tested on another distribution. Even retraining the model on the new data distribution may give us a completely different adversarial robustness on the same new distribution. This is also in sharp contrast to the clean accuracy of standard training, which, as we show in later sections, is insensitive to such shifts. To our best knowledge, our paper is the first work in the literature that demonstrates such sensitivity.",,,
67856213,GANSYNTH: ADVERSARIAL NEURAL AUDIO SYNTHESIS,"Efficient audio synthesis is an inherently difficult machine learning task, as human perception is sensitive to both global structure and fine-scale waveform coherence.

In contrast, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have global latent conditioning and efficient parallel sampling, but struggle to generate locally-coherent audio waveforms. Herein, we demonstrate that GANs can in fact generate high-fidelity and locally-coherent audio by modeling log magnitudes and instantaneous frequencies with sufficient frequency resolution in the spectral domain. Through extensive empirical investigations on the NSynth dataset, we demonstrate that GANs are able to outperform strong WaveNet baselines on automated and human evaluation metrics, and efficiently generate audio several orders of magnitude faster than their autoregressive counterparts. 1",,,

Decades of research and engineering went into designing fast iterative solution methods. Existing solvers are general purpose, but may be sub-optimal for specific classes of problems. In contrast to existing hand-crafted solutions, we propose an approach to learn a fast iterative solver tailored to a specific domain. We achieve this goal by learning to modify the updates of an existing solver using a deep neural network. Crucially, our approach is proven to preserve strong correctness and convergence guarantees.

When processing video, a convolutional network expends a fixed amount of computation for each frame with no regard to the similarity between neighbouring frames. As a result, it ends up repeatedly doing very similar computations. To put an end to such waste, we introduce Sigma-Delta networks. With each new input, each layer in this network sends a discretized form of its change in activation to the next layer. Thus the amount of computation that the network does scales with the amount of change in the input and layer activations, rather than the size of the network. We introduce an optimization method for converting any pre-trained deep network into an optimally efficient Sigma-Delta network, and show that our algorithm, if run on the appropriate hardware, could cut at least an order of magnitude from the computational cost of processing video data.",,,

Best viewed in electronic format.AbstractWe present a simple nearest-neighbor (NN) approach that synthesizes high-frequency photorealistic images from an ""incomplete"" signal such as a low-resolution image, a surface normal map, or edges. Current state-of-the-art deep generative models designed for such conditional image synthesis lack two important things: (1) they are unable to generate a large set of diverse outputs, due to the mode collapse problem. (2) they are not interpretable, making it difficult to control the synthesized output. We demonstrate that NN approaches potentially address such limitations, but suffer in accuracy on small datasets. We design a simple pipeline that combines the best of both worlds: the first stage uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to maps the input to a (overly-smoothed) image, and the second stage uses a pixel-wise nearest neighbor method to map the smoothed output to multiple high-quality, highfrequency outputs in a controllable manner. We demonstrate our approach for various input modalities, and for various domains ranging from human faces to cats-and-dogs to shoes and handbags.",,,
7047554,Low-Rank Approximations for Conditional Feedforward Computation in Deep Neural Networks,"Scalability properties of deep neural networks raise key research questions, particularly as the problems considered become larger and more challenging. This paper expands on the idea of conditional computation introduced in [2], where the nodes of a deep network are augmented by a set of gating units that determine when a node should be calculated. By factorizing the weight matrix into a low-rank approximation, an estimation of the sign of the pre-nonlinearity activation can be efficiently obtained. For networks using rectified-linear hidden units, this implies that the computation of a hidden unit with an estimated negative pre-nonlinearity can be omitted altogether, as its value will become zero when nonlinearity is applied. For sparse neural networks, this can result in considerable speed gains. Experimental results using the MNIST and SVHN data sets with a fully-connected deep neural network demonstrate the performance robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to the error introduced by the conditional computation process.",,,

This paper presents OLLIE, a substantially improved Open IE system that addresses both these limitations. First, OLLIE achieves high yield by extracting relations mediated by nouns, adjectives, and more. Second, a context-analysis step increases precision by including contextual information from the sentence in the extractions.

Autoencoders have the potential to address this need, but are difficult to optimize directly due to the inherent non-differentiabilty of the compression loss. We here show that minimal changes to the loss are sufficient to train deep autoencoders competitive with JPEG 2000 and outperforming recently proposed approaches based on RNNs.

As even very low error rates can limit practical usage of such systems, methods that perform closer to human accuracy remain desirable. In this work, we propose a new type of network with the following properties that address what we hypothesize to be limiting aspects of existing methods: (1) a 'wide' structure with thousands of features, (2) a large field of view, (3) recursive iterations that exploit statistical dependencies in label space, and (4) a parallelizable architecture that can be trained in a fraction of the time compared to benchmark multilayer convolutional networks. For the specific image labeling problem of boundary prediction, we also introduce a novel example weighting algorithm that improves segmentation accuracy. Experiments in the challenging domain of connectomic reconstruction of neural circuity from 3d electron microscopy data show that these ""Deep And Wide Multiscale Recursive"" (DAWMR) networks lead to new levels of image labeling performance.

92327,Statistical Approaches to Computer-Assisted Translation,"Universitat Jaume I Current machine translation (MT) systems are still not perfect. In practice, the output from these systems needs to be edited to correct errors. A way of increasing the productivity of the whole translation process (MT plus human work) is to incorporate the human correction activities within the translation process itself, thereby shifting the MT paradigm to that of computer-assisted translation. This model entails an iterative process in which the human translator activity is included in the loop: In each iteration, a prefix of the translation is validated (accepted or amended) by the human and the system computes its best (or n-best) translation suffix hypothesis to complete this prefix. A successful framework for MT is the so-called statistical (or pattern recognition) framework. Interestingly, within this framework, the adaptation of MT systems to the interactive scenario affects mainly the search process, allowing a great reuse of successful techniques and models. In this article, alignment templates, phrase-based models, and stochastic finite-state transducers are used to develop computer-assisted translation systems. These systems were assessed in a European project (TransType2) in two real tasks: The translation of printer manuals; manuals and the translation of the Bulletin of the European Union.

9268430,From Language to Programs: Bridging Reinforcement Learning and Maximum Marginal Likelihood,"Our goal is to learn a semantic parser that maps natural language utterances into executable programs when only indirect supervision is available: examples are labeled with the correct execution result, but not the program itself. Consequently, we must search the space of programs for those that output the correct result, while not being misled by spurious programs: incorrect programs that coincidentally output the correct result. We connect two common learning paradigms, reinforcement learning (RL) and maximum marginal likelihood (MML), and then present a new learning algorithm that combines the strengths of both. The new algorithm guards against spurious programs by combining the systematic search traditionally employed in MML with the randomized exploration of RL, and by updating parameters such that probability is spread more evenly across consistent programs. We apply our learning algorithm to a new neural semantic parser and show significant gains over existing state-of-theart results on a recent context-dependent semantic parsing task.",,,
94224,Understanding Locally Competitive Networks,"Recently proposed neural network activation functions such as rectified linear, maxout, and local winner-take-all have allowed for faster and more effective training of deep neural architectures on large and complex datasets. The common trait among these functions is that they implement local competition between small groups of units within a layer, so that only part of the network is activated for any given input pattern. In this paper, we attempt to visualize and understand this self-modularization, and suggest a unified explanation for the beneficial properties of such networks. We also show how our insights can be directly useful for efficiently performing retrieval over large datasets using neural networks.Recently proposed activation functions for neural networks such as rectified linear (ReL;[1]), maxout [2] and LWTA [3] are quite unlike sigmoidal activation functions. These functions depart from the conventional wisdom in that they are not continuously differentiable (and sometimes non-continuous) and are piecewise linear. Nevertheless, many researchers have found that such networks can be trained faster and better than sigmoidal networks, and they are increasingly in use for learning from large and complex datasets[4,5]. Past research has shown observational evidence that such networks have beneficial properties such as not requiring unsupervised training for weight initialization [1], better gradient flow [2] and mitigation of catastrophic forgetting[3,6]. Recently, the expressive power of deep networks with such functions has been theoretically analyzed[7]. However, we are far from a complete understanding of their behavior and advantages over sigmoidal networks, especially during learning. This paper sheds additional light on the properties of such networks by interpreting them as models of models.A common theme among the ReL, maxout and LWTA activation functions is that they are locally competitive. Maxout and LWTA utilize explicit competition between units in small groups within a layer, while in the case of the rectified linear function, the weighted input sum competes with a fixed value of 0. Related activation techniques have been studied in the past decades, including recurrent networks with locally competitive units [8]. Selfdelimiting recurrent networks with competitive units[3,9]can in principle learn to decide their own run time and effective number of parameters, thus learning their own computable regularizers. In this paper, we restrict our analysis to networks trained with gradient-based algorithms which are often trained with the dropout regularization technique [10, 11] for improved generalization.We start from the observation that in locally competitive networks, a subnetwork of units has non-zero activations for each input pattern. Instead of treating a neural network as a complicated highly nonlinear function approximator, the expressive power of the network can be interpreted to be coming from its ability to activate different subsets of linear units 1",,,
9725544,Towards Metamerism via Foveated Style Transfer,"Given the recent successes of deep learning applied to style transfer and texture synthesis, we propose a new theoretical framework to construct visual metamers: a family of perceptually identical, yet physically different images. We review work both in neuroscience related to metameric stimuli, as well as computer vision research in style transfer. We propose our NeuroFovea metamer model that is based on a mixture of peripheral representations and style transfer forward-pass algorithms for any image from the recent work of Adaptive Instance Normalization (Huang & Belongie). Our model is parametrized by a VGG-Net versus a set of joint statistics of complex wavelet coefficients which allows us to encode images in high dimensional space and interpolate between the content and texture information. We empirically show that human observers discriminate our metamers at a similar rate as the metamers of Freeman & Simoncelli (FS) In addition, our NeuroFovea metamer model gives us the benefit of near real-time generation which presents a ×1000 speed-up compared to previous work. Critically, psychophysical studies show that both the FS and NeuroFovea metamers are discriminable from the original images highlighting an important limitation of current metamer generation methods.",,,

We enhance the objective function of Neural Programmer, a neural network with built-in discrete operations, and apply it on WikiTableQuestions, a natural language question-answering dataset. The model is trained end-to-end with weak supervision of question-answer pairs, and does not require domain-specific grammars, rules, or annotations that are key elements in previous approaches to program induction. The main experimental result in this paper is that a single Neural Programmer model achieves 34.2% accuracy using only 10,000 examples with weak supervision. An ensemble of 15 models, with a trivial combination technique, achieves 37.7% accuracy, which is competitive to the current state-of-the-art accuracy of 37.1% obtained by a traditional natural language semantic parser.Recently, many neural network models have been developed for program induction (Andreas et al.,",,,
9870160,Attention-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Relation Classification,"Relation classification is an important semantic processing task in the field of natural language processing (NLP). State-ofthe-art systems still rely on lexical resources such as WordNet or NLP systems like dependency parser and named entity recognizers (NER) to get high-level features. Another challenge is that important information can appear at any position in the sentence. To tackle these problems, we propose Attention-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks(Att-BLSTM) to capture the most important semantic information in a sentence. The experimental results on the SemEval-2010 relation classification task show that our method outperforms most of the existing methods, with only word vectors.",,,
997870,DIVIDE-AND-CONQUER REINFORCEMENT LEARNING,"Standard model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms sample a new initial state for each trial, allowing them to optimize policies that can perform well even in highly stochastic environments. However, problems that exhibit considerable initial state variation typically produce high-variance gradient estimates for model-free RL, making direct policy or value function optimization challenging. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm that instead optimizes an ensemble of policies, each on a different ""slice"" of the initial state space, and gradually unifies them into a single policy that can succeed on the whole state space. This approach, which we term divide-and-conquer RL, is able to solve complex tasks where conventional deep RL methods are ineffective. Our results show that divide-and-conquer RL greatly outperforms conventional policy gradient methods on challenging grasping, manipulation, and locomotion tasks, and exceeds the performance of a variety of prior methods. Videos of policies learned by our algorithm can be viewed here.",,,
