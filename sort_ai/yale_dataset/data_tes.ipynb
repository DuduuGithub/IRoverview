      "Under mild conditions on the network initialization we derive a power series expansion for the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) of arbitrarily deep feedforward networks in the infinite width limit. We provide expressions for the coefficients of this power series which depend on both the Hermite coefficients of the activation function as well as the depth of the network. We observe faster decay of the Hermite coefficients leads to faster decay in the NTK coefficients and explore the role of depth. Using this series, first we relate the effective rank of the NTK to the effective rank of the inputdata Gram. Second, for data drawn uniformly on the sphere we study the eigenvalues of the NTK, analyzing the impact of the choice of activation function. Finally, for generic data and activation functions with sufficiently fast Hermite coefficient decay, we derive an asymptotic upper bound on the spectrum of the NTK.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Neural networks currently dominate modern artificial intelligence, however, despite their empirical success establishing a principled theoretical foundation for them remains an active challenge. The key difficulties are that neural networks induce nonconvex optimization objectives (Sontag & Sussmann, 1989) and typically operate in an overparameterized regime which precludes classical statistical learning theory (Anthony & Bartlett, 2002). The persistent success of overparameterized models tuned via non-convex optimization suggests that the relationship between the parameterization, optimization, and generalization is more sophisticated than that which can be addressed using classical theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "A recent breakthrough on understanding the success of overparameterized networks was established through the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) (Jacot et al., 2018). In the infinite width limit the optimization dynamics are described entirely by the NTK and the parameterization behaves like a linear model . In this regime explicit guarantees for the optimization and generalization can be obtained (Du et al., 2019a,b;Arora et al., 2019a;Allen-Zhu et al., 2019;Zou et al., 2020). While one must be judicious when extrapolating insights from the NTK to finite width networks (Lee et al., 2020), the NTK remains one of the most promising avenues for understanding deep learning on a principled basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spectrum of the NTK is fundamental to both the optimization and generalization of wide networks. In particular, bounding the smallest eigenvalue of the NTK Gram matrix is a staple technique for establishing convergence guarantees for the optimization (Du et al., 2019a,b;Oymak & Soltanolkotabi, 2020). Furthermore, the full spectrum of the NTK Gram matrix governs the dynamics of the empirical risk (Arora et al., 2019b), and the eigenvalues of the associated integral operator characterize the dynamics of the generalization error outside the training set (Bowman & Montufar, 2022;Bowman & Montúfar, 2022). Moreover, the decay rate of the generalization error for Gaussian process regression using the NTK can be characterized by the decay rate of the spectrum (Caponnetto & De Vito, 2007;Cui et al., 2021;Jin et al., 2022).\n",

      "The importance of the spectrum of the NTK has led to a variety of efforts to characterize its structure via random matrix theory and other tools (Yang & Salman, 2019;Fan & Wang, 2020). There is a broader body of work studying the closely related Conjugate Kernel, Fisher Information Matrix, and Hessian (Poole et al., 2016;Pennington & Worah, 2017Louart et al., 2018;Karakida et al., 2020). These results often require complex random matrix theory or operate in a regime where the input dimension is sent to infinity.

      "Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK): the NTK was introduced by Jacot et al. (2018), who demonstrated that in the infinite width limit neural network optimization is described via a kernel gradient descent. As a consequence, when the network is polynomially wide in the number of samples, global convergence guarantees for gradient descent can be obtained (Du et al., 2019a,b;Allen-Zhu et al., 2019;Zou & Gu, 2019;Zou et al., 2020;Oymak & Soltanolkotabi, 2020;Nguyen & Mondelli, 2020;Nguyen, 2021). Furthermore, the connection between infinite width networks and Gaussian processes, which traces back to Neal (1996), has been reinvigorated in light of the NTK.

      "Analysis of NTK Spectrum: theoretical analysis of the NTK spectrum via random matrix theory was investigated by Yang & Salman (2019); Fan & Wang (2020) in the high dimensional limit. Velikanov & Yarotsky (2021) demonstrated that for ReLU networks the spectrum of the NTK integral operator asymptotically follows a power law, which is consistent with our results for the uniform data distribution. Basri et al. (2019) calculated the NTK spectrum for shallow ReLU networks under the uniform distribution, which was then expanded to the nonuniform case by Basri et al. (2020). Geifman et al. (2022) analyzed the spectrum of the conjugate kernel and NTK for convolutional networks with ReLU activations whose pixels are uniformly distributed on the sphere. Geifman et al.

Oymak & Soltanolkotabi (2020) use Hermite expansion to study the NTK and establish a quantitative bound on the smallest eigenvalue for shallow networks. This approach was incorporated by Nguyen & Mondelli (2020) to handle convergence for deep networks, with sharp bounds on the smallest NTK eigenvalue for deep ReLU networks provided by . The Hermite approach was utilized by Panigrahi et al. (2020) to analyze the smallest NTK eigenvalue of shallow networks under various activations. Finally, in a concurrent work Han et al.

In Appendix B.4 we provide preliminary results in this direction, upper bounding, in a very specific setting, the decay of the NTK coefficients for depths l ≥ 2. Finally, we briefly pause here to highlight the potential for using a truncation of (5) in order to perform efficient numerical approximation of the infinite width NTK. We remark that this idea is also addressed in a concurrent work by Han et al. (2022), albeit under a somewhat different set of assumptions 1 . As per our observations thus far that the coefficients of the NTK power series (5) typically decay quite rapidly, one might consider approximating Θ (l) by computing just the first few terms in each series of (5). Figure 2 in Appendix B.3 displays the absolute error between the truncated ReLU NTK and the analytical expression for the ReLU NTK, which is also defined in Appendix B.3. Letting ρ denote the input correlation then the key takeaway is that while for |ρ| close to one the approximation is poor, for |ρ| < 0.5, which is arguably more realistic for real-world data, with just 50 coefficients machine level precision can be achieved.

By contrast, a well-conditioned matrix would have an effective rank that is Ω(n). Combining Theorem 4.1 and the Markov-type bound (10) we make the following important observation. Observation 4.2. The largest eigenvalue λ 1 (K) of the NTK takes up an Ω(1) fraction of the entire trace and there are O(1) eigenvalues on the same order of magnitude as λ 1 (K), where the O(1) and Ω(1) notation are with respect to the parameter n.\n",

      "In Figure 1 we empirically validate our theory by computing the spectrum of the NTK on both Caltech101 (Li et al., 2022) and isotropic Gaussian data for feedforward networks. We use the functorch 2 module in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) using an algorithmic approach inspired by Novak et al. (2022). As per Theorem 4.1 and Observation 4.2, we observe all network architectures exhibit a dominant outlier eigenvalue due to the nonzero constant coefficient in the power series. Furthermore, this dominant outlier becomes more pronounced with depth, as can be observed if one carries out the calculations described in Theorem 3.1. Additionally, this outlier is most pronounced for ReLU, as the combination of its Gaussian mean plus bias term is the largest out of the activations considered here. As predicted by Theorem 4.3, Observation 4.4 and Theorem 4.5, we observe real-world data, which has a skewed spectrum and hence a low effective rank, results in the spectrum of the NTK being skewed. By contrast, isotropic Gaussian data has a flat spectrum, and as a result beyond the outlier the decay of eigenvalues of the NTK is more gradual. These observations support the claim that the NTK inherits its spectral structure from the data. We also observe that the spectrum for Tanh is closer to the linear activation relative to ReLU: intuitively this should not be surprising as close to the origin Tanh is well approximated by the identity. Our theory provides a formal explanation for this observation, indeed, the power series coefficients for Tanh networks decay quickly relative to ReLU. We provide further experimental results in Appendix C.3, including for CNNs where we observe the same trends. We note that the effective rank has implications for the generalization error. The Rademacher complexity of a kernel method (and hence the NTK model) within a parameter ball is determined by its its trace (Bartlett & Mendelson, 2002). Since for the NTK λ 1 (K) = O(1), lower effective rank implies smaller trace and hence limited complexity. Figure 1: (Feedforward NTK Spectrum) We plot the normalized eigenvalues λ p /λ 1 of the NTK Gram matrix K and the data Gram matrix XX T for Caltech101 and isotropic Gaussian datasets. To compute the NTK we randomly initialize feedforward networks of depths 2 and 5 with width 500. We use the standard parameterization and Pytorch's default Kaiming uniform initialization in order to better connect our results with what is used in practice.

      "Under the Assumption 1, the preactivations at each layer l ∈ [L + 1] converge also in distribution to centered Gaussian processes (Neal, 1996;Lee et al., 2018). We remark that the sequential width limit condition of Assumption 1 is not necessary for this behavior, for example the same result can be derived in the setting where the widths of the network are sent to infinity simultaneously under certain conditions on the activation function (de G. Matthews et al., 2018). However, as our interests lie in analyzing the limit rather than the conditions for convergence to said limit, for simplicity we consider only the sequential width limit. As per Lee et al. (2018, Eq. 4), the covariance between the preactivations of the αth and βth neurons at layer l ≥ 2 for any input pair x, y ∈ R are described by the following kernel,\n",

      "We refer to this kernel as the Gaussian kernel. As each neuron is identically distributed and the covariance between pairs of neurons is 0 unless α = β, moving forward we drop the subscript and discuss only the covariance between the preactivations of an arbitrary neuron given two inputs. As per the discussion by Lee et al. (2018, Section 2.3), the expectations involved in the computation of these Gaussian kernels can be computed with respect to a bivariate Gaussian distribution, whose covariance matrix has three distinct entries: the variance of a preactivation of x at the previous layer, Σ (l−1) (x, x), the variance of a preactivation of y at the previous layer, Σ (l) (y, y), and the covariance between preactivations of x and y, Σ (l−1) (x, y). Therefore the Gaussian kernel, or covariance function, and its derivative, which we will require later for our analysis of the NTK, can be computed via the the following recurrence relations, see for instance (Lee et al., 2018;Jacot et al., 2018;Arora et al., 2019b;,\n",

However, in the setting where the squares of the Hermite coefficients, and therefore the series (α p,2 ) ∞ p=0 , decay at an exponential rate, this quantity can be characterized and therefore an analysis, at least to a certain degree, of the impact of depth conducted. Although admittedly limited in scope, we highlight that this setting is relevant for the study of Gaussian activation functions and radial basis function (RBF) networks. We will also make the additional simplifying assumption that the activation function has zero Gaussian mean (which can be obtained by centering). Unfortunately this further reduces the applicability of the following results to activation functions commonly used in practice.

For the feedforward architectures we consider networks of depth 2 and 5 with the width of all layers being set at 500. With regard to the activation function we test linear, ReLU and Tanh, and in terms of initialization we use Kaiming uniform (He et al., 2015), which is very common in practice and is the default in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019). For the convolutional architectures we again consider depths 2 and 5, with each layer consisting of 100 channels with the filter size set to 5x5. In terms of data, we consider 40x40 patches from both real world images, generated by applying Pytorch's RandomResizedCrop transform to a random batch of Caltech101 images (Li et al., 2022), as well as synthetic images corresponding to isotropic Gaussian vectors. The batch sized is fixed at 200 and we plot only the first 100 normalized eigenvalues. Each experiment was repeated 10 times. Finally, to compute the NTK we use the functorch 4 module in PyTorch using an algorithmic approach inspired by Novak et al. (2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "The results for convolutional neural networks show the same trends as observed in feedforward neural networks, which we discussed in Section 4.1. In particular, we again observe the dominant outlier eigenvalue, which increases with both depth and the size of the Gaussian mean of the activation. We also again see that the NTK spectrum inherits its structure from the data, i.e., is skewed for skewed data or relatively flat for isotropic Gaussian data. Finally, we also see that the spectrum for Tanh is closer to the spectrum for the linear activation when compared with the ReLU spectrum.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of differences between the CNN and FCNN experiments, we observe that the spread of the 95% confidence interval is slightly larger for convolutional nets, implying a slightly larger variance between trials. We remark that this is likely attributable to the fact that there are only 100 channels in each layer and by increasing this quantity we would expect the variance to reduce. In summary, despite the fact that our analysis is concerned with FCNNs, it appears that the broad implications and trends also hold for CNNs. We leave a thorough study of the NTK spectrum for CNNs and other network architectures to future work. Figure 3: (NTK Spectrum for CNNs) We plot the normalized eigenvalues λ p /λ 1 of the NTK Gram matrix K and the data Gram matrix XX T for Caltech101 and isotropic Gaussian datasets. To compute the NTK, we randomly initialize convolutional neural networks of depth 2 and 5 with 100 channels per layer. We use the standard parameterization and Pytorch's default Kaiming uniform initialization in order to better connect our results with what is used in practice. We consider a batch size of n = 200 and plot the first 100 eigenvalues. The thick part of each curve corresponds to the mean across 10 trials while the transparent part corresponds to the 95% confidence interval. To test our theory in Section 4.2, we numerically plot the spectrum of NTK of two-layer feedforward networks with ReLU, Tanh, and Gaussian activations in Figure 4. The input data are uniformly drawn from S 2 . Notice that when d = 2, k = Θ( 1/2 ). Then Corollary 4.7 shows that for the ReLU activation λ = Θ( −3/2 ), for the Tanh activation λ = O −3/4 exp(− π 2 1/4 ) , and for the Gaussian activation λ = O( −1/2 2 − 1/2 ).

Under the same setting as in Theorem 4.6, 1. if c p = Θ(p −a ) where a ≥ 1, then λ k = Θ(k −d−2a+2 ), 2. if c p = δ (p even) Θ(p −a ), then λ k = δ (k even) Θ(k −d−2a+2 ),4. if c p = Θ(p 1/2 a −p ), then λ k = O k −d+1 a −k and λ k = Ω k −d/2+1 2 −k a −k .Proof of Corollary C.4, part 1. We first prove λ k = O(k −d−2a+2 ). Suppose that c p ≤ Cp −a for some constant C, then according to Theorem 4.6 we haveAccording to Stirling's formula, we haveWe defineBy applying the chain rule to e log fa(p) , we have that the derivative of f a is f a (p) = (p + 1) p+ 1 2 p −a 2(p − k + 1)Then g a (p) and f a (p) have the same sign. Next we will show that g a (p) ≥ 0 for k ≤ p ≤ k 2 d+24a when k is large enough.First when p ≥ k andwhen k is sufficiently large.Second when p ≥ k and 0 ≤.when k is sufficiently large. Also we haveCombining all the arguments above, we conclude that g a (p) ≥ 0 and f a (p) ≥ 0 when k ≤ p ≤ k 2 d+24a . Then whenWhen p ≥ k 2 d+24a , we have f a (p) = p −a (p + 1)which is a constant independent of k. Then for p ≥ k 2 d+24a , we haveFinally we haveProof of Corollary C.4, part 4. Since c p = Θ(p 1/2 a −p ), we have that c p ≤ Cp 1/2 a −p for some constant C. Similar to (65), we haveUse the definition in (66) and let a = 0, we have f 0 (p) = (p + 1)Then according to(69)and(70), for sufficiently large k, we have f 0 (p) ≤ f 0Overall, for all p ≥ k, we haveThen we haveOn the other hand, since c p = Θ(p 1/2 a −p ), we have that c p ≥ C p 1/2 a −p for some constant C . Similar to (73), we havep≥k p−k is even p 1/2 a −p (p + 1)≥ 2π d/2 2 d 2 e d 2 C 2 1 C C 2 2 k 1/2 a −k (k + 1)= Ω k −d/2+1 a −k (k + 1)Since (k + 1) k = k k (1 + 1/k) k = Θ(k k ).
