As such, the current paper proposes a new measurement for\nquantifying journals' diversity by utilizing the abstracts of scientific publica-\ntions in journals, namely topic diversity ( TD). Specifically, we apply a topic\ndetection method to extract fine-grained topics, rather than disciplines, in\njournals and adapt certain diversity indicators to calculate TD. Since TDonly\nneeds as inputs abstracts of publications rather than citing relationships\nbetween publications, this measurement has the potential to be widely used in\nscientometrics.\n1|INTRODUCTION\nStudies on interdisciplinary scientific research have been\nquite popular in scientometrics and social studies of sci-ence. Wagner et al. (2011) defined interdisciplinarity as\nintegration of separate disciplinary data, methods, tools,\nconcepts, and theories to create a holistic view or com-mon understanding of a complex issue, question, or prob-lem. To quantify interdisciplinarity, bibliometricians\nhave built up many useful indicators or measurements,\nsuch as diversity (e.g., Leydesdorff, Wagner, &Bornmann, 2019), entropy (e.g., Stirling, 2007), and\nbetweenness centrality (e.g., Leydesdorff, 2007). Among\nthese, diversity is a concept from ecology by Stir-ling (2007) and Rafols and Meyer (2010) that takes three\ncomponents into account, namely variety (number of cat-\negories), balance (relative number of elements in eachcategory), and disparity (difference or similarity between\ncategories).\nOne branch of studies on diversity aims to quantify\nthe degree of interdisciplinarity of journals. Rousseauand Glanzel (2016), for instance, employed a newdiversity measurement from Leinster and Cobbold (2012).\nThey combined human-made discipline classification\nschema, citation analysis, and their diversity measure-\nment to quantify journals' diversity. Leydesdorff, Wagner,and Bornmann (2018) ranked journals' interdisciplinarity\nby exploring different functions of betweenness centrality\nand diversity in various types of journal-level scholarlynetworks (e.g., citation, co-citation, and bibliographiccoupling).\nAlthough there are many existing studies focusing\non diversity measurements in scientometrics (e.g.,Leydesdorff, 2007; Leydesdorff, Kushnir, & Rafols, 2014;\nLeydesdorff & Rafols, 2011; Rafols & Meyer, 2010;\nSkupin, Biberstine, & Borner, 2013), “disciplines ”and\n“subjects ”in these indicators are mostly represented by\nmanually assigned categories —for instance, Zhang\net al. (2016) employed the Leuven-Budapest (ECOOM)subject-classification scheme. Yet, there are at least three\nlimitations of adopting such human-assigned schemes for\ndiversity measurements. First, these schemes are static sothey could not reflect the dynamics of discipline or sub-ject evolution and structures. For instance, Frank, Wang,\nCebrian, and Rahwan (2019) observed that the field of\nartificial intelligence is being combined with\nYi Bu and Mengyang Li contributed equally to this study.Received: 12 November 2019 Revised: 27 September 2020 Accepted: 17 October 2020\nDOI: 10.1002/asi.24433\nJ Assoc Inf Sci Technol. 2021;72:523 –539. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/asi © 2020 Association for Information Science and Technology 523\n"
