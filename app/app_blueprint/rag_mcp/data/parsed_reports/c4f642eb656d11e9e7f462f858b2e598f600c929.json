However, the\nway that science advances itself is much less well-understood. In\nthis work, we study the evolution of scienti/f_ic development over\nthe past century by presenting an anatomy of 89 million digitalized\npapers published between 1900 and 2015. We /f_ind that science has\nbene/f_ited from the shi/f_t from individual work to collaborative eﬀort,\nwith over 90% of the world-leading innovations generated by col-\nlaborations in this century, nearly four times higher than they were\nin the 1900s. We discover that rather than the frequent myopic-\nand self-referencing that was common in the early 20thcentury,\nmodern scientists instead tend to look for literature further back\nand farther around. Finally, we also observe the globalization of sci-\nenti/f_ic development from 1900 to 2015, including 25-fold and 7-fold\nincreases in international collaborations and citations, respectively,\nas well as a dramatic decline in the dominant accumulation of ci-\ntations by the US, the UK, and Germany, from ∼95% to∼50% over\nthe same period. Our discoveries are meant to serve as a starter\nfor exploring the visionary ways in which science has developed\nthroughout the past century, generating insight into and an impact\nupon the current scienti/f_ic innovations and funding policies.\nCCS CONCEPTS\n•Information systems →Link and co-citation analysis; •Social\nand professional topics →Government technology policy;\nKEYWORDS\nScience of Science; Diversity in Science; Funding Policy; Scienti/f_ic\nImpact; Big Data; Microso/f_t Academic Graph\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor pro/f_it or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the /f_irst page.

It oﬀers the potential to predict, change,\nand ultimately invent the future. Over the course of human history,\nthe advancement of science has been increasingly responsible for\ntechnological and societal evolution. Traced back thousands of\nyears, Aristotle’s scienti/f_ic discoveries and methods profoundly\nshaped the development of Western civilization. In the modern\nera, breakthroughs in information theory led to the successive\ninventions of the telegraph, telephone, television, and Internet,\nfacilitating today’s global /f_low of ideas. Formerly unimaginable\ninnovations in aeronautics and astronautics have further enabled\nthe mobilization of people, li/f_ting us not only across the planet but\nalso, even if only at a nascent stage, into the universe itself.\nNotwithstanding the driving force of science in societal develop-\nment, knowledge concerning the way that science advances itself is\nsorely lacking. Yet, its advancement is continuously being recorded,\nwith each scientist—past, present, and future—leaving an indelible\nmark on the process of scienti/f_ic innovation through his or her\nresearch publications, contributing to an ever-expanding body of\nscienti/f_ic literature. /T_he digitization of scienti/f_ic publications over\nthe past century, itself enabled by science, now oﬀers an unprece-\ndented opportunity to study the development of science by using\nscience: the “science of science” [6, 17, 34].\nIn this work, we study the evolution of science over the past cen-\ntury according to three dimensions. First, we examine the evolving\nprocess of collaborations between scientists of diﬀerent career-ages,\ninstitutions, and countries. Second, we characterize referencing\nbehavior over time, with an emphasis on both its individual and\ncollective dynamics. Finally, we investigate the rise and fall of scien-\nti/f_ic impact across the planet since 1900. Our study is performed on\na large-scale scholarly dataset comprised of more than 89 million\npublications, 795 million citations, and 1.23 billion collaboration re-\nlationships spanning from 1900 to 2015, making this the largest-scale\nand longest-spanning analysis yet performed on academic data.\narXiv:1704.05150v2  [cs.DL]  4 Oct 2017"
