        "text": "Title: Bed Rest, Collapse, and Streptomycin in the Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis\n\nAbstract: The toxicity of streptomycin was investigated in 31 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis which received one gram of the drug daily for six weeks and was found to be negligible. The in vitro determination of the streptomycin sensitivity of tubercle bacilli cultured from the sputum or gastric contents of 61 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis was determined after terminating a course of streptomycin. A definite tendency for the bacilli to develop in vitro and probably in vivo resistance to the drug was noted regardless of the dosage or the duration of therapy. The type of disease being treated and the response observed following streptomycin treatment has been shown to influence the tendency for streptomycin resistant strains of tubercle bacilli to emerge. The decision to administer streptomycin to a case of tuberculosis should be made with due regard for the type of lesion being treated and with the realization that one course of therapy may deprive the patient of the beneficial effect of the durg at a later date.\n\n"
