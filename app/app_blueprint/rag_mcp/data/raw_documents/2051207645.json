The onset of meningitis relative to the time of injection of LCM virus was delayed and the maximal level of cellular extravasation into cerebrospinal fluid was lower in C3H/HeJ and CBA/H compared with AKR/J, B10.Br and BALB/c.H-2k mice. Adoptive transfer experiments indicated that the C3H mice are genuine low responders, but immune spleen cells from the CBA/H were as potent on a cell-for-cell basis as those from the AKR/J. Further analysis with CBA/H, AKR/J and (CBA/H Ã— AKR/J)F1 mice showed that the pattern of high response for the AKR/J was dominant, with the differential kinetics of the development of meningitis correlating with the cellularity of the cervical lymph nodes. Thus, the generation of the LCM inflammatory process is not dictated solely by the MHC phenotype.\n\n"
