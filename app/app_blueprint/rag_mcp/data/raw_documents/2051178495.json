        "text": "Title: Photoionization of ground and excited states of neon type Ti XIII\n\nAbstract: The R-matrix method is used to calculate the photoionization cross-section of Ti XIII from its ground and first three excited states. The results are obtained for photon energies ranging from the first ionization threshold to just above the second ionization threshold of the residual ion Ti XIV. Configuration interaction wavefunctions are used to describe the initial Ti XII and final Ti XIV states. The positions and effective quantum numbers for the Rydberg series converging to the excited state 2s2p6 2Se of the residual ion, are predicted.\n\n"
