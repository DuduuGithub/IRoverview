        "text": "Title: SPIN-FLUCTUATION THERMOPOWER IN Pd-Ni ALLOYS\n\nAbstract: The anomalous peaks at <v 20K in the thermopower, S, of paramagnetic Pd-Ni alloys have been investigated further by an experimental study of S in dilute (Pd99Ni1),_ Pt alloys in the temperature 1.5K to 30K. It is found that as x is increased from 0 to 1 % the pronounced (negative) peak in S virtually disappears. This result con be simply explained by a change in the diffusion component of S as the dominant electron-scatterer changes from Ni to Pt, and weighs heavily against the idea of paramagnon drag.\n\n"
