        "text": "Title: Analysis of ACPW-to-Microstrip Transition with ANN-MRTD Method\n\nAbstract: This paper combines artificial neural network technique with the MRTD method (ANN-MRTD) and give detailed illustration of this method. The MRTD equation is embedded into training algorithms of the artificial neural network. A novel asymmetrical coplanar waveguide (ACPW) to microstrip transition is proposed, different center frequency of transition can be obtained by adjusting dimension of ACPW. The transition is analyzed with ANN-MRTD method, and the results are provided. The correctness and effectiveness of ANN-MRTD method are verified by the results.\n\n"
