        "text": "Title: Theory of Extended Pseudopotentials\n\nAbstract: Extended pseudopotential V p ' is defined as superposition of a pseudopotential in a usual sense, and an attractive potential which originates from orthogonalization procedure to higher-lying states. The pseudo-Hamiltonian with V p ' is shown to generate the same valence levels as the real Hamiltonian does, and spurious non-valence levels as well. A particular form of V p ' is proposed, which is obtained from the constraint that none of the non-valence levels should lie in the valence region. It is shown that, with the particular V p ' , the core-coupled non-valence states have complex eigenvalues. The theory enables us to work with only in a restricted energy region of interest. Applications and limitations of the theory are discussed.\n\n"
