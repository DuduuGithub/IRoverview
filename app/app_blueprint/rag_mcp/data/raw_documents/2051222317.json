        "text": "Title: Confronting the Spirit of Our Age as a Creator of Chaos\n\nAbstract: Contemporary civilization has created a fundamental contradiction between the intellectual approach to knowing and the technical approach to doing on the one hand, and the results of their application on the other. These approaches to knowing and doing begin with a process of abstraction that trades breadth for depth, while their application reveals a multitude of problems associated with ignoring the fact that everything is related to everything else in our world. Scientific disciplines and technical specialties create “pure” domains of investigation “uncontaminated” by interactions with all other domains, thereby distorting the internal fabric of relations and its connections with everything else. Hence, the most powerful means humanity has ever created are indissociably linked with the production of chaos in human life, society, and the biosphere. A new domain of study is needed to the interactions between society, technology, science, and the biosphere (STSB). The scope, direction, and methodological challenges are briefly examined, and the possible mission of STSB within the contemporary university.\n\n"
