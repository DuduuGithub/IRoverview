The films were exposed at scales of 1:40,000, 1:20,000, and 1:5,000. A number of ground targets common to the four films were identified and measured densitometrically. The densitometric readings were converted to Munsell Color System designations to provide a comparative reference for color and saturation differences. Hue shifts of 5% (1:20,000) to 19% (1:5,000) were encountered between films. Color saturation levels were noted to be higher with the Agfa H100 film. Sensitometric tests using normal, one push, and two push processing were also performed to evaluate average gradients, film speeds, and color bias for the four films. Characteristic curve symmetry was most adversely affected by push processing the Kodak Aerocolor 2445 film and least adversely affected by pushing the Kodak RAS 686 film. EAFS values consistently increased with the Agfa emulsions but remained stable or decreased with the Kodak emulsions during push processing. Color bias generally tended to the red with the C-41 type films and blue-magenta with the Kodak 2445 film. Resolution characteristics were analyzed by photographing a bar ground target at the 1:5,000 scale. Best resolution performance (normal processing) was noted with the Agfa N200 and Kodak RAS 686 films.\n\nKeywords: Optics, Physics, Composite material, Materials science\n\n"
