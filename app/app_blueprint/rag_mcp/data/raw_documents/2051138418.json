        "text": "Title: The Principle of Plasma Boundary Identification on HL-2A Tokamak\n\nAbstract: Plasma boundary identification is a basic task for studies on equilibrium and confinement in a divertor tokamak. With the progress on the experiments after engineering experiments, the boundary identification becomes an important issue for HL-2A. In order to satisfy the requirements of preciseness, simplified measurements and quickness, the filament current method instead of solving the equilibrium equations is used to identify plasma boundary on HL-2A. The involved principle, mathematics and the progresses, which have been made with this method, are given.\n\nKeywords: Identification (biology), Physics, Mathematical analysis, Nuclear physics, Mathematics, Botany, Plasma, Biology\n\n"
