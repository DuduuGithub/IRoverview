Annual arithmetic mean concentrations of indoor 222Rn, 220Rn and its progeny were 25, 232 and 0.7 Bq mâˆ’3, respectively. Although seasonal variation of indoor 222Rn was observed, variations of indoor 220Rn and its progeny were not obvious. Indoor 220Rn progeny concentration might be roughly estimated from measuring indoor 220Rn.\n\n"
