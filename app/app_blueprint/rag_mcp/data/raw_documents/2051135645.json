Her antibody levels were measured as 0.01 U/ml (protective levels >0.01 U/ml) and were therefore not protective. The isolate of C tetani was identified by 16S sequencing. The potential to produce tetanus toxin was determined by detection of a fragment of the C tetani neurotoxin gene. She was given a week long course of oral flucloxacillin, 500 mg four times a day and metronidazole, 400 mg three times a day, for 5 days. The patient was subsequently given prophylactic immunoglobulin (500 IU) as per guidelines. The fact that the patient did not manifest any symptoms of localised or generalised tetanus could be attributed to prompt management when she presented to her primary care site.\n\nKeywords: Pathology, Intensive care medicine, Bacteria, Genetics, Medicine, Biology, Microbiology\n\n"
