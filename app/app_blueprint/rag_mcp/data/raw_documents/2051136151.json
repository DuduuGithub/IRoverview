        "text": "Title: Fabrication of 128×128 element optical switch array by micromachining technology\n\nAbstract: Abstract Polycrystalline VO 2 thin films were obtained on Si substrates by ion beam sputtering deposition and annealing in flowing Ar gas. SEM images indicate that VO 2 thin films were grown into compact surfaces. Four-probe measurements indicated that the VO 2 thin films own good electrical homogeneity. After the films’ production, micromachining technology including lithography, reaction ion etching and metallization connection processes was used to produce the optical switch array. As a result, the 128×128 element optical switch array was achieved.\n\nKeywords: Pathology, Embedded system, Political science, Law, Alternative medicine, Computer science, Medicine\n\n"
