The soluble polymer of PPF yielded by allyl polymerization bearing 1.8 × 104 ( DP ¯ = 78 ) as the highest molecular weight initiated with di-tert-butyl peroxide was produced instead of cyclized polymer bearing 6-membered-ring structure. The polymer possesses perfluoroisopropenyl groups in side chains.\n\n"
