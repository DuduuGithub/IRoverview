Isobutene was formed in 99% yield through first-order reactions having the following Arrhenius parameters (A,s−1, Ea, kJ mol−1): MPSA, log A = 12.41 ± 0.02, Ea = 158.8 ± 0.2; MOSA, log A = 12.91 ± 0.22, Ea = 159 ± 3. It is proposed that the elimination of isobutene takes place by unimolecular reaction mechanisms involving polar, four-center cyclic transition states, forming S-unsubstituted thiohydroxylamines as co-products. Thermochemical parameters, estimated by semiempirical AM1 calculations, are reported for the latter and for the parent molecules. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\n"
