A strong InPd attraction and a weak InFe repulsion were determined in a nickel host. The In/Cd probe sensed magnetic hyperfine field shifts caused by Fe impurities in three nearest neighbour shells around the probe, while no magnetic-moment perturbation was found due to Pd impurity atoms in a nickel host.\n\n"
