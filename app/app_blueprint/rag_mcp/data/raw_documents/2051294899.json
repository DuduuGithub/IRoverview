Making use of refraction enhancement scheme in optics, we get a matching medium layer named as anti-reflection. It is capable of propagating the wave through the imaginary medium completely. Numerical experiment has been proved that the method is efficient by applying to the finite-difference time-domain solver.\n\n"
