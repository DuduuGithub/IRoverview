        "text": "Title: Ugandan Couples May Discuss Reproductive Issues, But Do Not Always Understand Each Other's Desires\n\nAbstract: 1356 men and 1600 women in the Masaka and Lira districts of Uganda participated in a 1995-96 study of couples communication regarding fertility and reproductive health issues. Findings are based upon survey responses and focus group discussions. Couples in Uganda seldom openly disagree about whether to use contraception with both partners often claiming to be the one who suggested that contraception be used. However some women use a contraceptive method without their partners knowledge. Men and women generally believe that they know their partners family-size desires even though couples rarely discuss the number of children they want to have. Furthermore approximately 50% and 25% of respondents feel that a woman has no right to refuse sexual intercourse with her husband because she wishes to avoid pregnancy or because she knows that he has AIDS respectively.\n\n"
