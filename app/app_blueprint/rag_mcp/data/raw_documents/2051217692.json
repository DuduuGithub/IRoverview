The study compared task performance time and functional abilities between patients rising from a supine position with or without gripping the edge of the bed. Subjects comprising 21 hemiplegic patients were divided into 2 groups: those who needed to grip the edge of the bed to rise from a supine position (Group G, n=7); and those who did not (Group NG, n=14). The 2 groups displayed no significant differences in background characteristics other than age, with mean age for Group G significantly higher than that for Group NG. Rising performance time and 11 items for physical functional abilities were measured in all subjects. Rising performance time was significantly higher in Group G than in Group NG (p<0.05). Neck-trunk-pelvis motor function was lower (p<0.01), muscle tone was abnormal in more subjects (p<0.05) and strength of trunk rotation to the unaffected side was weak in more subjects (p<0.05) in Group G than in Group NG. No other physical functional abilities differed significantly between groups. These results suggest that patients rising from a supine position by gripping the edge of the bed display restricted task performance, and the main factors leading to a requirement for grip assistance seem to be abnormality and disability of trunk functions.\n\n"
