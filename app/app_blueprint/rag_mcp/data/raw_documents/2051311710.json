The proposed scheme allows control of a wide class of robotic systems in hard real-time. To take advantage of Simulink graphic programming interfaces, robotic programming environment, middleware and library are also presented based on Matlab/Simulink/RTW toolchain. Experiments are presented to show the performance on current computing hardware.\n\n"
