Several different β-CD derivatives were tested for the chiral separation of non-natural carboxylic amino acid, and it was proved that HP-β-CD could show better chiral selectivity. The separation of enantiomers of amino acid was obtained by CE in a 50-μm i.d.×60 cm (effective length 45 cm) fused-silica capillary at 18 kV voltage, while 10 mM phosphate acted as running buffer and HP-β-CD served as selective material. The detective wavelength was set at 254 nm.\n\nKeywords: Composite material, Catalysis, Organic chemistry, Chemistry, Materials science, Chromatography, Amino acid, Biochemistry\n\n"
