        "text": "Title: Hemostasis - Therapeutic Alternatives to the Laser\n\nAbstract: In clinical practice, there are a number of other endoscopic procedures for attaining hemostasis available as alternatives to laser hemostasis. Of these the following may be emphasized: Modified electrocoagulation procedures such as EHT coagulation, bipolar or multipolar coagulation, and sclerotherapy. The efficacy of these \"laser-alternative\" methods of hemostasis has already been demonstrated in clinical studies, and is unquestioned. Large comparative investigations that would provide definitive information on the relative effectiveness of the various techniques, have yet to be carried out. If, however, we consider such aspects as practicability and economy, the laser would appear to be a \"dinosaur\" among the endoscopic procedures presently available for hemostasis. The oldest recognized fiber-endoscopic instrument for hemostasis, it is anything but highly mobile, and is bound to a fixed location. In addition, it is as expensive as a museum exhibit. If the only indication for its use were hemostasis, it would probably have vanished from the scene.\n\n"
