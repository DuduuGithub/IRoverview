Interactive engagement classroom techniques have been shown to help alleviate this problem. This paper describes progress in addressing the problem from a different direction — that of students’ out-of-class study. Results from investigations employing several commonly used assessment instruments indicate that out-of-class study time can indeed be utilized to improve student learning of basic physics concepts.\n\n"
