There were 14 males and four females. All patients had failed decannulation after endoscopic management (from three to 38 procedures). Nine patients had total or near total glottic and/or subglottic obstruction. All these children underwent open laryngotracheoplasty through a laryngofissure with placement of a stent. The stents used consisted of an Aboulker Teflon stent incorporated into a Holinger metal tracheotomy tube, or with the stent placed above the tube. Sixteen patients had long stents placed and two patients had short stents placed. Short stents were used when there was no significant tracheal lesion and were usually in place four to five weeks.
