The goal of the present experiment was to determine whether stimulus compounding could produce analogous enhancements of a classically conditioned drug effect. Food-maintained responding in rats was suppressed by a tone and a light that were individually paired with response-independent cocaine (3 mg/kg iv). This conditioned suppression was significantly enhanced when the stimuli were presented together in a stimulus-compounding test. The magnitude of this enhancement was similar to that in previous studies in which responding was suppressed by shock-paired stimuli. These results demonstrate that multiple drug-related cues interact in a predictable manner to influence both operant and classically conditioned behavior.\n\n"
