Dispatcher-assisted CPR (D-CPR) uses dispatchers to assist the caller to perform CPR, and enhance survival. We aimed to assess the effect of D-CPR on survival and neurological outcome after CA in an urban EMS system. Material and methods: All non-traumatic out-of-hospital CA cases in Prague, Czech republic in 2004–2005 were analysed retrospectively and all cases, where the victim was not reported by the caller as “being conscious” in the time of first emergency call were included to the study. The D-CPR was performed by modified protocol with higher compressions: ventilations ratio (100:2) or even by compression-only. Survival to hospital admission and the neurologic outcome as the best achieved cerebral performance category (CPC) within 30 days from admission served as the primary and secondary outcome parameters, respectively. Results: We reviewed 601 cases. D-CPR was provided in 266 cases (DCPR+ group), while in 335 cases it was not (DCPR− group). Response times (mean ± S.D.) were 8:09 ± 2:41 in DCPR+ versus 8:01 ± 2:49 min in DCPR−, respectively (p = NS). VF/first rhythm ratio was 0.34 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.27–0.41) in DCPR+ and 0.35 (95%CI, 0.29–0.41) in DCPR− group, respectively (p = NS). In the DCPR+ group, 108 (38.1%) patients survived to hospital admission; 44 of them (16.5%) survived with CPC5. In DCPR− group, 94 (25.8%) victims survived to hospital admission and 34 (10.1%) achieved favorable neurologic outcome. Survival-to-admission was higher in the DCPR+ group versus DCPR− group (p = 0.007). Also, survival with good neurological outcome (CPC5 versus CPC1-4) was significantly higher in DCPR+ versus DCPR− group (p = 0.027). Conclusions: Both survival-to-admission and survival with good neurological outcome rates were significantly higher in D-CPR+ group. D-CPR appears to be a safe and effective way to increase survival from out-of-hospital CA.References [1]A statement for healthcare professionals from task force of the ILCOR–cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation outcome reports: update and simplification of the utstein templates for resuscitation registres.
