Various OR techniques and identification techniques have been used. This study allows a better understanding of the role that local intensity of the earthquake and epicentre play, and a suitable statistical model of the phenomen is formulated and tested. More important, it is shown that this statistical model may be reinterpreted as a causal model in structural engineering, and various aspects of this representation are discussed.\n\n"
