Using the transmitting and receiving mutual impedances, a “coupled power” concept is introduced. This concept is applied to work out an optimal transmission scheme when a non-negligible mutual coupling between antenna elements exists. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed transmission strategy leads to gaining an extra capacity. A practical antenna design including a suitable choice of antenna elements separation is discussed for the case of a semi-correlated uplink channel.\n\n"
