We report a case of a 50-year-old female who presented with multiple, veracious non-tender papules coalescing to form multiple plaques of varied diameter perioral, which was gradually progressive. On the basis of history, clinical presentation and histopathology, diagnosis of KCM was confirmed. We report this case because of atypical presentation and clinical rarity.\n\n"
