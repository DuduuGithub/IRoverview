In this paper we study the lossless coding of such graphics data with the objective to come to recommendations for video compression of such images. For this purpose, a comparison has been made between contour coding, template coding and run-length coding of graphical imagery. It is concluded that template coding is suitable for TXT-like images but it is not practical for more generic graphics images. For menus and similar imagery, contour and run-length coding provide interesting options.\n\n"
