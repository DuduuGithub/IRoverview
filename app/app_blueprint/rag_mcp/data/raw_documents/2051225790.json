A series of international conflicts such as the Italian wars of 1859 and 1866 and, particularly, the Prussian war of 1866 clearly demonstrated that Austria was no longer the major military power that it had been during the long decades when Prince Metternichis Holy Alliance system was at work.

To what extent was it indeed based on the principle of idualismi and how much did it retain from the absolutist legacy of the Habsburg Empire? The debate about these questions is almost older than the newly established system itself, as discussions were started right during the formative years of the Dual Monarchy. Theoretically, the Monarchy became divided into two legally equal parts with their relations based on parity. The two parts were internally sovereign, with their own legislative, legal, and law enforcing mechanisms. It was the common monarch who regulated their relationship at the topmost level, while the three most important icommoni affairs were managed jointly. 2 Some of these icommoni affairs such as foreign policy, defense and finances related to those two were de\n\n"
