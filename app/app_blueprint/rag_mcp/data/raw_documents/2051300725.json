The crystalline structures, micro-morphologies and electrochemical performances of LiFePO 4 /C composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and galvanostatic charge-discharge, respectively. The results indicated that the LiFePO 4 nanoparticles showed the homogeneous particle size distribution and were bound together by carbon network when carbon content was 3.9wt%. Moreover, this sample exhibited the highest initial discharge capacity of 154.8 mAh·g -1 at 0.15 C rate, excellent cyclic ability and rate capability about 99.6 mAh·g -1 applied 5 C rate in the 20th cycle at room temperature.\n\n"
