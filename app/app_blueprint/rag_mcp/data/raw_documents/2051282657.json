        "text": "Title: Further experiments upon flame propagation through dry carbonic oxide-oxygen mixtures in an electric field\n\nAbstract: In a previous paper from our laboratories in 1929, an experiment was described showing photographically the effects of a strong electric field upon the explosive combustion of a 2CO + O 2 medium which, after being intensively dried by 240 daysâ€™ contact with redistilled phosphoric anhydride, was ignited in a tube by a condenser discharge mid-way between the two poles of the field. It was shown that, as compared with a similar experiment but without an electric field, although on ignition flames started in opposite directions along the tube with velocities rather slower than in the corresponding experiment without the field, they were soon progressively accelerated, but more so towards one pole (afterwards found to be the negative) than towards the other, and that, upon the field finally breaking down shortly before the flames reached the poles, the combustion became highly accelerated.\n\n"
