The calculation with six stretching and one bending force constants provides good agreement for the observed Raman and infrared wavenumbers. The Al—X interatomic force constants of its bonds were found to be stronger than the Cd—X interatomic force constants. The three dominant force constants have a constant ratio when S is replaced by Se. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\n"
