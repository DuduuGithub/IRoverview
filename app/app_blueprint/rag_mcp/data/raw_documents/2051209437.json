However, the likelihood of Au embrittlement in connector solder joints must be minimized by eliminating much of the Au plating from the surfaces using a hot solder dipping or “wicking” procedure prior to final assembly. It was observed that Au removal was most effective by using a double wicking process. Also, a higher soldering temperature improved the efficiency of the Au removal process. A longer soldering time during the wicking process did not appear to offer an appreciable improvement in Au removal. Because the wicking procedure was a manual process, it was found to be operator dependent.\n\n"
