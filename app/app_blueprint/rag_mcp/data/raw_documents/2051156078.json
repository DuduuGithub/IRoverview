        "text": "Title: Y-chromosome lineages from Portugal, Madeira and Açores record elements of Sephardim and Berber ancestry\n\nAbstract: A total of 553 Y-chromosomes were analyzed from mainland Portugal and the Archipelagos of Açores and Madeira, in order to characterize the genetic composition of their male gene pool. A large majority of the male lineages could be classified as belonging to three basic Y chromosomal haplogroups R1b, J, and E3b. While R1b, accounting for more than half of the lineages in any of the subpopulations, is a characteristic marker of many different West European populations, haplogroups J and E3b consist of lineages that are typical of the circum-Mediterranean region or Eastern Africa. The present composition of the Y chromosomes in Portugal in E3b haplogroup likely reflects a pre-Arab component shared with North African populations or testifies, at least in part, the influence of Sephardic Jews. A marginally low sub-Saharan African Y chromosome component indicates the presence of sex-related gene flow, most likely mediated by the Atlantic slave trade.\n\n"
