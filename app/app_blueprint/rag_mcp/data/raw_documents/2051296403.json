        "text": "Title: Dutch proposal for children's right to euthanasia withdrawn\n\nAbstract: The Dutch government has withdrawn proposed euthanasia legislation for children aged 12–16 years. The so-called “child paragraph” in a pending bill gave children within this age-group, in a situation of hopeless suffering, the right to choose euthanasia, even if their parents opposed this wish. The paragraph is part of the proposed comprehensive euthanasia and physician-assisted-suicide legislation that was presented in parliament last year.\n\n"
