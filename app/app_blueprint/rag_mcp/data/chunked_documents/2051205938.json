In order to use the measured ft values for these purposes, one must first apply theoretical corrections for isospin-symmetry-breaking and radiative effects. In recent years, the nuclear-structure-dependent isospin-symmetry-breaking calculations have been placed under intense scrutiny; concurrently, experimental work has measured these corrections in cases where they are relatively large. The present status of comparisons of experiment to theory is reviewed.\n\n"
