        "text": "Title: Psychometric Assessment of Parent Trust in School-Located Immunization Programs: Language Variables Matter\n\nAbstract: School-located immunization programs (SLIP) remove barriers to care and have the potential of increasing vaccination rates among populations. Patient trust in SLIPs (the belief that a health care provider will provide the utmost care in addressing one's interests and needs during a time of vulnerability) could potentially influence the use of these programs. While there are a few published scales to assess patient trust in providers and health settings, no scales exist to specifically assess paitent trust in SLIPs. We assessed the reliability of a modified patient trust measure for use with a SLIP among parents of middle school students in a predominantly urban Hispanic population. Prior to initiating a service project to provide vaccines via a mobile SLIP to 8 urban middle schools, questionnaires were distributed to students either in school enrollment packets or within a month of the start of school. Questionnaire distribution pre-dated notification that a SLIP would be available at the school. Surveys were provided in both English and Spanish; each parent could complete the forms in his/her preferred language. Demographic items assessed age, race, ethnicity, language spoken at home, insurance status, whether the child had a medical home, and annual household income. A 5-item patient trust in provider scale previously used among English speaking adults was modified in English and Spanish for use pertaining SLIPs. The Spanish translation was reviewed/reverse-translated to assure accuracy. Item 1 in the tool was a reverse-worded item designed to prevent rote responses. Internal consistency of the measure was assessed using Cronbach's alpha; data were then stratified by demographic variables. 1913 questionnaires were included in the analysis. 68% of parents were primarily Spanish-speaking; 40% completed the Spanish version of the survey, and 84% identified as Hispanic. The Cronbach's alpha for the 5-item scale was 0.71. Cronbach alpha was different when stratifying for demographic variables; most notably higher for those using the Spanish vs English version (0.76 vs. 0.64), for those who spoke English vs Spanish at home (0.79 vs. 0.68), and for those with annual household incomes above vs. below $50,000 (0.81 vs. 0.71). The modified trust scale for SLIP(s) showed adequate internal consistency among a sample of predominately Hispanic parents of middle school students. However, internal consistency of this scale was lower among Spanish speakers than English speakers and those with higher incomes. In addition, among this primarily Hispanic population, the Spanish version of the survey demonstrated higher internal consistency. These data suggest a need to further evaluate and modify this scale for populations with significant variation in language variables and socioeconomic status.\n\n"
