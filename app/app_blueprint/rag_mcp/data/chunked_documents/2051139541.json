I presume that a specific configuration of preexisting, but separately ineffective uncoating ATPase binding sites, is responsible for the triggering of its action. Changes in the geometrical structure of clathrin that inevitably appear during the coated pit-coated vesicle conversion, place the preexisting uncoating ATPase recognition sites into the necessary disposition.\n\nKeywords: Biophysics, Enzyme, Chemistry, Membrane, Biochemistry, Biology, Cell biology\n\n"
