The uses of these observations for determining the change in the component of deviation of the vertical, the average temperature of the air and the strength of an inversion layer between two observers is discussed. Their use for transferring height is also discussed and the results of a field comparison of levelling and angular observations corrected according to the derived formulae are given.\n\n"
