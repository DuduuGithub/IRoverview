We analysed the antigen‐presenting processes in the induction of IL‐2 responsiveness. Non‐adherent responder cells cultured with Df‐pulsed autologous adherent cells acquired IL‐2 responsiveness, which decreased after prolonged culture of adherent cells for 72 h before recombination with fresh autologous non‐adherent cells. HLA‐DQ expression on cultured adherent cells also decreased in parallel with the reduction of their ability to induce IL‐2 responsiveness. However, the treatment of adherent cells with IFN‐γ restored the expression of these HLA‐Class 2 antigens mainly on CD14+ antigen‐presenting cells (monocytes.), but not on CD20+ cells (B cells), which overcame the decrease of Df‐induced IL‐2 responsiveness during prolonged culture. These data suggest that IFN‐γ potentiates the up‐regulation of Df‐specific IL‐2 responsiveness, which is likely to depend on the restoration of HLA‐DQ expression on monocytes.\n\n"
