Its extreme length is 5.5 cm., and its diameter at its meatal end is 6 mm. in vertical, by 4 mm. in transverse diameter. This renders it more adaptable to the shape of the meatus. It is nickel-plated both within and without, which gives it a better reflecting surface than possessed by the black-rubber Siegle instrument found in the shops. The two small openings on its inner wall, at the point connecting it with the air-tube, act like a sieve, to prevent the drawing up of particles of cerumen or dirt into the operator's mouth—another advantage over the ordinary Siegle instrument.
