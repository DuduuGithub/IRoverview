In both baseband and envelope cases the solitary wave solutions are unstable upon mutual interaction. Envelope propagation has less distortion after interaction, but instability in baseband case can be easily removed by incorporating a small amount of a fifth-order saturating nonlinearity in the system.\n\n"
