The most commonly accessed features were billing code lists (29% of total views); the intranet home page (27%); faculty telephone and pager numbers (2.6%); digital dictation access codes (1.6%); and magnetic resonance imaging protocols (1.5%). A total of 32,408 files, including daily clinical assignments, monthly fellow and resident schedules, and protocol forms, were downloaded as portable document files by intranet users.The intranet has proved an invaluable addition to the authors' departmental infrastructure, as evidenced by its extensive use by the staff. It has facilitated the rapid dissemination of information without hard copy.\n\n"
