Amplitudes of selected VLF transmitter signals are presented, confirming the existence of disturbed ionospheric conditions over a wide geographical area. Comparison of signal perturbations on various pairs of paths from common transmitters provides evidence of disturbed conditions at L values greater than 6.\n\n"
