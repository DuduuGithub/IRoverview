An investigation is made of the population difference kinetics and the pulse temporal profile under SRRS conditions. It is shown that allowance for the pump depletion imposes an additional constraint on the observation of SRRS, i.e., an upper limit of ~1019 cm–3 for the density of the medium. It it is noted that as a result, observation of SRRS is more likely in gaseous media.\n\n"
