        "text": "Title: Degradation of galvanised iron roofing material in Tanzania by atmospheric corrosion\n\nAbstract: Galvanised iron is popular in many applications, particular as a roofing material. However, just like other materials, especially metallic ones, it is prone to degradation by corrosion. In this particular study, the degradation of galvanised roof sheets was investigated at a coastal, urban and rural site in Tanzania, Africa. Samples were exposed to various outdoor environments over a period of 3 years. In addition, some accelerated laboratory investigations were conducted in different simulated air pollution environments in an artificial corrosion chamber constructed for this purpose to supplement the outdoor exposure tests. It was found that the combination of the tropical climate and increasing air pollution due to industrial development in the capital Dar-es-Salaam resulted in substantial atmospheric corrosion of the roof sheets, which eventually leads to failure and the necessity for replacement. The rural site had the lowest degree of atmospheric corrosion as expected. A combination of different corrosion products was identified as a result of the atmospheric corrosion by Raman and EDX analyses. The information gained from this investigation could be utilised to construct more durable structures requiring less frequent replacement and maintenance in future.\n\n"
