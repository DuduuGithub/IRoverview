Most publications describe the treatment process of the therapeutic community, not the outcome. Action research of a therapeutic community for acute psychiatric patients started in 1975. The essential content of its therapeutic process has been described earlier. The outcome of 963 patients first admitted between 1975 and 1981 was evaluated. By stepwise logistic regression analysis the positive outcome was found to be correlated to the activity of individual, milieu, and group therapy. Interaction seemed to correlate very positively with the positive outcome, which consisted of 52% of all patients. There was also a large group of controversial (32%) and negative (15%) outcomes among these newcomers. The treatment policy of the ward was changed after the study to an interaction-enhancing system-oriented therapeutic community, so that the therapeutic challenge of these problem patients could be met better than earlier. The influence of this developmental process on the outcome is still under study, but the clinical impression is encouraging.\n\n"
