A novel method for SLN identification is by injection of a labeled colloid. We examined the optimal preoperative timing for this injection. Seven pts with primary tumor were injected with 60 MBq (TCK-17A) 99mTc Rhenium Colloid. Scintigraphy was done 30 min and 2, 6 and 24 h postinjection. After the final scan, the pt went to surgery where the SLN was localized with a gamma detecting probe (Neoprobe 1000) at a ratio of 15: 1 (LN/bed of resection). SLN excision was followed by regional LN dissection. Scintigraphy visualized the SLN in all 7 pts by the 2-hr scan and remained identifiable at the 24-hr scan. Pathology showed one positive LN and was the only involved LN in this patient. In all other 6 pts, neither the SLNs nor the regional LNs were involved. Thus, 24-hrs before surgery was found to be the optimal time for injection, and is being used in further study of the SLN concept.
