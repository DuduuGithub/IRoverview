Removal of glucose from the oxygenated Krebs solution produced an outward current associated with an increased K+ conductance. The glucosedepletion depressed the excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), the inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) and the late hyperpolarizing current (LHC) produced by stimulation of the fimbria/fornix pathway. It is hypothesized that glucose regulates neurotransmission in the rat DLSN by modulating the release of transmitters from presynaptic nerve terminals.\n\n"
