The efficiency of the algorithm in SOA systems with extremely high input traffic is studied. The analysis of dependency of algorithm performance on such parameters as Committed Information Rate (CIR), Committed Burst Size (CBS) and Excess Burst Size (EBS) is done.\n\nKeywords: Distributed computing, World Wide Web, Art, Visual arts, Artificial intelligence, Economics, Service (business), Computer network, Computer science\n\n"
