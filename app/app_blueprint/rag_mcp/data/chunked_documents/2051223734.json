A significant association was observed between higher expression levels of MMP9 and low risk group and absence of extramedullary infiltration and higher expression levels of TIMP2 and MMP2 with T-ALL. TIMP1 gene expression values higher than the median were associated with a significantly lower 5-year event free-survival in univariable (P = 0.04) and multivariable analysis (P = 0.01). Our data address new information in the complex interaction of the migration/adhesion genes and childhood ALL.\n\n"
