In this paper, we present a real-time rendering technique based on stroke textures which allows interactive variation of the stroke style. This is done by encoding texture look-ups into stroke textures and defining the stroke style in single-stroke textures. At runtime the choice of strokes and stroke style is made using the per-pixel programmability of today's graphics hardware.\n\n"
