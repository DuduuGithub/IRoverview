In this framework, concept structure are modeled by a Cellular Automaton for Symbolic Induction (CASI). Our objective is to reduce time categorization caused by the Concept Lattice. We examine, by experiments the performance of the proposed approach and compare it with other algorithms such as Naive Bayes and k nearest neighbors. The results show performance improvement while reducing time categorization.\n\n"
