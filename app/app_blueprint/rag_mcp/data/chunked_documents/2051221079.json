It is shown that the maximum resolving power of laser lithography in the case of nondestructive interaction corresponds to the resolving power of the optical system employed, whereas in the case of destructive interaction it is governed by the properties of film and substrate materials, by the film thickness, and by the irradiation regime. The conditions ensuring maximal resolving power of laser thermolithography are determined.\n\n"
