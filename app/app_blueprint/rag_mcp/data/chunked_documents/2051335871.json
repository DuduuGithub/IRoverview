Because the two hormones share many functional properties, and exhibit similar effects on neurons, the possibility of common early signaling events has been explored. Many studies have focused on the important role of protein phosphorylation. Two distinct but related mechanisms are discussed that may mediate, in part, the ability of these two hormones to regulate the activities of protein kinases and phosphatases.\n\n"
